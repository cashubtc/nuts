NUT-04: Mint tokens
==========================

`mandatory`

---

Minting tokens is a two-step process: requesting a mint quote and minting new tokens. Here, we describe both steps. 

In the first request the wallet asks the mint for a quote for a specific `amount` and `unit` to mint, and the payment `method` to pay. The mint responds with a quote that includes a `quote` id and a payment `request`. The user pays the `request` and, if successful, requests minting of new tokens with the mint in a second request. The wallet includes the `quote` id and new `outputs` in the second request.

We limit this document to mint quotes of `unit="sat"` and `method="bolt11"` which requests a bolt11 Lightning invoice (typically generated by the mint to add Bitcoin to its reserves) to mint ecash denominated in Satoshis. 

# Mint quote

To request a mint quote, the wallet of `Alice` makes a `POST /v1/mint/quote/{method}` request where `method` is the payment method requested (here `bolt11`). 

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/mint/quote/bolt11
```

The wallet of `Alice` includes the following `PostMintQuoteBolt11Request` data in its request:

```json
{
  "amount": <int>,
  "unit": <str_enum["sat"]>
}
```
 with the requested `amount` and the `unit`. 
 
 The mint `Bob` then responds with a `PostMintQuoteBolt11Response`:

```json
{
  "quote": <str>,
  "request": <str>,
  "paid": <bool>,
  "expiry": <int>
}
```

Where `quote` is the quote ID and `request` is the payment request to fulfill. `paid` indicates whether the request as been paid and `expiry` is the Unix timestamp until which the mint quote is valid.

Note: `quote` is a **unique and random** id generated by the mint to internally look up the payment state. `quote` **MUST** remain a secret between user and mint and **MUST NOT** be derivable from the payment request. A third party who knows the `quote` ID can front-run and steal the tokens that this operation mints.

## Example

Request of `Alice` with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3338/v1/mint/quote/bolt11 -d '{"amount": 10, "unit": "sat"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Response of `Bob`:

```json
{
  "quote": "DSGLX9kevM...",
  "request": "lnbc100n1pj4apw9...",
  "paid": false,
  "expiry": 1701704757
}
```

The wallet **MUST** store the `amount` in the request and the `quote` id in the response in its database so it can later request the tokens after paying the request. After payment, the wallet continues with the next section.

## Check mint quote state

To check whether a mint quote has been paid, `Alice` makes a `GET /v1/mint/quote/bolt11/{quote_id}`.

```http
GET https://mint.host:3338/v1/mint/quote/bolt11/{quote_id}
```

Like before, the mint `Bob` responds with a `PostMintQuoteBolt11Response`.

Example request of `Alice` with curl:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3338/v1/mint/quote/bolt11/DSGLX9kevM...
```

# Minting tokens

After requesting a mint quote and paying the request, the wallet proceeds with minting new tokens by calling the `POST /v1/mint/{method}` endpoint where `method` is the payment method requested (here `bolt11`).

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/mint/bolt11
```

The wallet `Alice` includes the following `PostMintBolt11Request` data in its request

```json
{
  "quote": <str>,
  "outputs": <Array[BlindedMessage]>
}
```
 with the `quote` being the quote ID from the previous step and `outputs` being `BlindedMessages` (see [NUT-00][00]) that the wallet requests signatures on whose sum is `amount` as requested in the quote.
 
 The mint `Bob` then responds with a `PostMintBolt11Response`:

```json
{
  "signatures": <Array[BlindSignature]>
}
```

where `signatures` is an array of blind signatures on the outputs.

## Example

Request of `Alice` with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/mint/bolt11 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
'{
  "quote": "DSGLX9kevM...",
  "outputs": [
    {
      "amount": 8,
      "id": "009a1f293253e41e",
      "B_": "035015e6d7ade60ba8426cefaf1832bbd27257636e44a76b922d78e79b47cb689d"
    },
    {
      "amount": 2,
      "id": "009a1f293253e41e",
      "B_": "0288d7649652d0a83fc9c966c969fb217f15904431e61a44b14999fabc1b5d9ac6"
    }
  ]
}'
```

Response of `Bob`: 

```json
{
  "signatures": [
    {
      "id": "009a1f293253e41e",
      "amount": 2,
      "C_": "0224f1c4c564230ad3d96c5033efdc425582397a5a7691d600202732edc6d4b1ec"
    },
    {
      "id": "009a1f293253e41e",
      "amount": 8,
      "C_": "0277d1de806ed177007e5b94a8139343b6382e472c752a74e99949d511f7194f6c"
    }
  ]
}
```

If the invoice was not paid yet, `Bob` responds with an error. In that case, `Alice` **CAN** repeat the same request until the Lightning invoice is settled.

## Unblinding signatures

Upon receiving the `BlindSignatures` from the mint `Bob`, the wallet of `Alice` unblinds them to generate `Proofs` (using the blinding factor `r` and the mint's public key `K`, see BDHKE [NUT-00][00]). The wallet then stores these `Proofs` in its database:

```json
[
  {
  "id": "009a1f293253e41e",
  "amount": 2,
  "secret": "407915bc212be61a77e3e6d2aeb4c727980bda51cd06a6afc29e2861768a7837",
  "C": "02bc9097997d81afb2cc7346b5e4345a9346bd2a506eb7958598a72f0cf85163ea"
  },
  {
  "id": "009a1f293253e41e",
  "amount": 8,
  "secret": "fe15109314e61d7756b0f8ee0f23a624acaa3f4e042f61433c728c7057b931be",
  "C": "029e8e5050b890a7d6c0968db16bc1d5d5fa040ea1de284f6ec69d61299f671059"
  }
]
```

## Settings
The settings for this nut indicate the supported method-unit pairs for minting and whether minting is disabled or not. They are part of the info response of the mint ([NUT-06][06]) which in this case reads 
```json
{
  "4": {
    "methods": [
      <MintMethodSetting>,
      ...
    ],
    "disabled": <bool>
  }
}
```

`MintMethodSetting` indicates supported `method` and `unit` pairs and additional settings of the mint. `disabled` indicates whether this minting is disabled.

`MintMethodSetting` is of the form:
```json
{
  "method": <str>,
  "unit": <str>,
  "min_amount": <int|null>,
  "max_amount": <int|null>
}
```
`min_amount` and `max_amount` indicate the minimum and maximum amount for an operation of this method-unit pair.

Example `MintMethodSetting`:

```json
{
  "method": "bolt11",
  "unit": "sat",
  "min_amount": 0,
  "max_amount": 10000        
}
```
