# NUT-04: Mint tokens

`mandatory`

`used in: NUT-20, NUT-23`

---

Minting tokens is a two-step process: requesting a mint quote and minting new tokens. This document describes the general flow that applies to all payment methods, with specifics for each supported payment method provided in dedicated NUTs.

## Supported methods

Method-specific NUTs describe how to handle different payment methods. The currently specified models are:

- [NUT-23][23] for bolt11 Lightning invoices

## General Flow

The minting process follows these steps for all payment methods:

1. The wallet requests a mint quote for the `unit` to mint, specifying the payment `method`.
2. The mint responds with a quote that includes a `quote` id and a payment `request`.
3. The user pays the `request` using the specified payment method.
4. The wallet then requests minting of new tokens with the mint, including the `quote` id and new `outputs`.
5. The mint verifies payment and returns blind signatures.

## Common Request and Response Formats

### Requesting a Mint Quote

To request a mint quote, the wallet of `Alice` makes a `POST /v1/mint/quote/{method}` request where `method` is the payment method requested (e.g., `bolt11`, `bolt12`, etc.).

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/mint/quote/{method}
```

Depending on the payment method, the request structure may vary, but all methods will include at minimum:

```json
{
  "unit": <str_enum[UNIT]>
  // Additional method-specific fields may be required
}
```

The mint `Bob` responds with a quote that includes some common fields for all methods:

```json
{
  "quote": <str>,
  "request": <str>,
  "unit":  <str_enum[UNIT]>,
  // Additional method-specific fields will be included
}
```

Where `quote` is the quote ID, `request` is the payment request for the quote, and `unit` corresponds to the value provided in the request.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> `quote` is a **unique and random** id generated by the mint to internally look up the payment state. `quote` **MUST** remain a secret between user and mint and **MUST NOT** be derivable from the payment request. A third party who knows the `quote` ID can front-run and steal the tokens that this operation mints. To prevent this, use [NUT-20][20] locks to enforce public key authentication during minting.

### Check Mint Quote State

To check whether a mint quote has been paid, the wallet makes a `GET /v1/mint/quote/{method}/{quote_id}`.

```http
GET https://mint.host:3338/v1/mint/quote/{method}/{quote_id}
```

The mint responds with the same structure as the initial quote response.

### Executing a Mint Quote

After requesting a mint quote and paying the request, the wallet proceeds with minting new tokens by calling the `POST /v1/mint/{method}` endpoint.

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/mint/{method}
```

The wallet includes the following common data in its request:

```json
{
  "quote": <str>,
  "outputs": <Array[BlindedMessage]>
}
```

with the `quote` being the quote ID from the previous step and `outputs` being `BlindedMessages` (see [NUT-00][00]) that the wallet requests signatures on, whose sum is `amount` as requested in the quote.

The mint then responds with:

```json
{
  "signatures": <Array[BlindSignature]>
}
```

where `signatures` is an array of blind signatures on the outputs.

## Adding New Payment Methods

To add a new payment method (e.g., BOLT12), implement the following:

1. Define the method-specific request and response structures following the pattern above
2. Implement the three required endpoints: quote request, quote check, and mint execution
3. Update the settings to include the new method

## Settings

The settings for this NUT indicate the supported method-unit pairs for minting. They are part of the info response of the mint ([NUT-06][06]) which reads:

```json
{
  "4": {
    "methods": [
      <MintMethodSetting>,
      ...
    ],
    "disabled": <bool>
  }
}
```

`MintMethodSetting` indicates supported `method` and `unit` pairs and additional settings of the mint. `disabled` indicates whether minting is disabled.

`MintMethodSetting` is of the form:

```json
{
  "method": <str>,
  "unit": <str>,
  "min_amount": <int|null>,
  "max_amount": <int|null>,
  "options": <Object|null>
}
```

`min_amount` and `max_amount` indicate the minimum and maximum amount for an operation of this method-unit pair. `options` are method-specific and can be defined in method-specific NUTs.

## Unblinding Signatures

Upon receiving the `BlindSignatures` from the mint, the wallet unblinds them to generate `Proofs` (using the blinding factor `r` and the mint's public key `K`, see BDHKE [NUT-00][00]). The wallet then stores these `Proofs` in its database.
