NUT-14: Partial multi-path payments
==========================

`optional` `depends on: NUT-05`

---

In this document, we describe how wallets can instruct multiple mints to each pay a partial amount of a bolt11 Lightning invoice. The full payment is composed from payments from multiple Lightning nodes each as a partial multi-path payment. This way, wallets can pay a larger Lightning invoice combined from multiple smaller balances on different mints. Due to the atomic nature of MPP, either all payments wil be successful or all of them will fail.

The Lightning backend of the mint must support paying a partial amount of an Invoice and multi-path payments (MPP, see [BOLT 4](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/04-onion-routing.md)). For example, the mint's Lightning node must be able to pay 50 sats of a 100 sat bolt11 invoice. The receiving Lightning node must support receiving multi-path payments as well.

# Multimint payment execution

`Alice`'s wallet coordinates multiple PMPPs on different mints that support the feature (see below for the indicated settings). For a given Lightning invoice of `amount_total`, `Alice` splits the total amount into several partial amounts `amount_total = amount_1 + amount_2 + ...` that each must be covered by her individual balances on the mints she wants to use for the payment. Then she constructs multiple `PostMeltQuoteBolt11Request`'s that each include the corresponding partial amount (see below) that she sends to all mints she wants to use for the payment. The mints then respond with a normal [NUT-05](PostMeltQuoteBolt11Response). `Alice` proceeds to pay the melt requests at each mint simultaneously. When all mints have sent out the Lightning payment, she receives a successful response from all mints individually.

# Melt quote

To request a melt quote with a partial `amount`, the wallet of `Alice` makes a `POST /v1/melt/quote/{method}` request where `method` is the payment method requested (here `bolt11`). 

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/melt/quote/bolt11
```

The wallet `Alice` includes the following `PostMeltQuoteBolt11Request` data in its request which includes an additional `amount` field compared to the standard request in [NUT-05][05]:

```json
{
  "request": <str>,
  "unit": <str_enum["sat"]>,
  "amount": <int>
}
```

Here, `request` is the bolt11 Lightning invoice to be paid, `unit` is the unit the wallet would like to pay with, and `amount` is the amount for the requested payment. The wallet then proceeds to paying the quote the same way as described in [NUT-05][05].

## Settings

The settings for this feature are indicated in the `MeltMethodSetting` (see [NUT-05][05]) that is returned the info endpoint ([NUT-06][06]) MUST indicate `method` and `unit` pairs that support `mpp`.

`MeltMethodSetting` is of the form:
```json
{
  ...
  "mpp": <bool>
}
```

Example `MeltMethodSetting`:

```json
{
  "method": "bolt11",
  "unit": "sat",
  "min_amount": 100,
  "max_amount": 10000,
  "mpp": true     
}
```
