# NUT-07: Token state check

`optional`

`used in: NUT-17, NUT-11, NUT-14`

---

With the token state check, wallets can ask the mint whether a specific proof is already spent and whether it is in-flight in a transaction. Wallets can also request the witness data that was used to spend a proof.

### Token states

A proof can be in one of the following states

- A proof is `UNSPENT` if it has not been spent yet
- A proof is `PENDING` if it is being processed in a transaction (in an ongoing payment). A `PENDING` proof cannot be used in another transaction until it is `live` again.
- A proof is `SPENT` if it has been redeemed and its secret is in the list of spent secrets of the mint.

**Note:** Before deleting spent proofs from their database, wallets can check if the proof is `SPENT` to make sure that they don't accidentally delete an unspent proof. Beware that this behavior can make it easier for the mint to correlate the sender to the receiver.

**Important:** Mints **MUST** remember which proofs are currently `PENDING` to avoid reuse of the same token in multiple concurrent transactions. This can be achieved with for example mutex lock whose key is the `Proof`'s `Y`.

## Use cases

#### Example 1: Ecash transaction

When `Alice` prepares a token to be sent to `Carol`, she can mark these tokens in her database as _pending_. She can then, periodically or upon user input, check with the mint if the token is `UNSPENT` or whether it has been redeemed by `Carol` already, i.e., is `SPENT`. If the proof is not spendable anymore (and, thus, has been redeemed by `Carol`), she can safely delete the proof from her database.

#### Example 2: Lightning payments

If `Alice`'s melt operation takes a long time to complete (for example if she requests a very slow Lightning payment) and she closes her wallet in the meantime, the next time she comes online, she can check all proofs marked as _pending_ in her database to determine whether the payment is still in flight (mint returns `PENDING`), it has succeeded (mint returns `SPENT`), or it has failed (mint returns `UNSPENT`).

## Example

**Request** of `Alice`:

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/checkstate
```

With the data being of the form `PostCheckStateRequest`:

```json
{
  "Ys": <Array[hex_str]>,
}
```

Where the elements of the array in `Ys` are the hexadecimal representation of the compressed point `Y = hash_to_curve(secret)` of the `Proof` to check (see [NUT-00][00]).

**Response** of `Bob`:

`Bob` responds with the states with a `PostCheckStateResponse`

```json
{
  "states": [
    {
      "Y": <hex_str>,
      "state": <str_enum[STATE]>,
      "witness": <str|null>,
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

The elements of the `states` array MUST be returned in the same order as the corresponding `Proofs` checked in the request.

- `Y` corresponds to the `Proof` checked in the request.
- `state` is an enum string field with possible values `"UNSPENT"`, `"PENDING"`, `"SPENT"`
- `witness` is the serialized witness data that was used to spend the `Proof` if the token has a [NUT-10][10] spending condition that requires a witness such as in the case of P2PK ([NUT-11][11]) or HTLCs ([NUT-14][14]).

With curl:

**Request** of `Alice`:

```bash
curl -X POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/checkstate -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "Ys": [
    "02599b9ea0a1ad4143706c2a5a4a568ce442dd4313e1cf1f7f0b58a317c1a355ee"
  ]
}'
```

**Response** of `Bob`:

```json
{
  "states": [
    {
      "Y": "02599b9ea0a1ad4143706c2a5a4a568ce442dd4313e1cf1f7f0b58a317c1a355ee",
      "state": "SPENT",
      "witness": "{\"signatures\": [\"b2cf120a49cb1ac3cb32e1bf5ccb6425e0a8372affdc1d41912ca35c13908062f269c0caa53607d4e1ac4c8563246c4c8a869e6ee124ea826fd4746f3515dc1e\"]}"
    }
  ]
}
```

Where `Y` belongs to the provided `Proof` to check in the request, `state` indicates its state, and `witness` is the witness data that was potentially provided in a previous spend operation (can be empty).
