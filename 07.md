NUT-07: Token state check
==========================

`optional` `author: calle`

---

With the spendable check, wallets can ask the mint whether a specific token is already spent (`spendable`) or pending in a transaction (`pending`). 

- A token is `not spendable` if it has been redeemed and its secret is in the list of spent secrets of the mint.
- A token is `pending` if it is being processed in a transaction (either being redeemed for another token or associated with an ongoing payment). A `pending` token cannot be used in another transaction until it is `not pending`.

**Important:** Before deleting spent tokens from their database, wallets MUST check if the token is still `spendable` to make sure that they don't delete an unspent token by accident.

## Use cases

**Example 1:** When `Alice` prepares a token to be sent to `Carol`, she can mark these tokens in her database as *db:pending*. She can then, periodically or upon user input, check with the mint, if the token is still spendable (mint returns `True` for `spendable`) or if it has been redeemed by `Carol` already (mint retrns `False` for `spendable`). If the token is not spendable anymore (and, thus, has been redeemed by `Carol`), she can safely delete the token from her database.

**Example 2:** If Alice pays a very slow Lightning invoice (for example a HODL invoice) and closes her wallet in the mean time, the next time she comes online, she can check all tokens marked as *db:pending* in her database to determine, whether the payment is still in flight (mint returns `True` for `pending` and `spendable`), it has succeeded (mint returns `False` for `pending` and `spendable`), or it has failed (mint returns `False` for `pending` and `True` for `spendable`).

## Example

**Request** of `Alice`:

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/check
```

With the data being of the form `CheckStateRequest`:

```json
{
  "proofs": Proofs
}
```

`Proofs` is a list (array) of `Proof`s (see [NUT-0][00]). `Alice` CAN provide a full `Proof` but MUST provide at least the `secret` (which is the only thing that `Bob` needs to check whether the token has been spent).

With curl:

```bash
curl -X POST https://mint.host:3338/check -d \
{
  "proofs": 
    [
      {
        "secret": "S+tDfc1Lfsrb06zaRdVTed6Izg"
      },
      {
      ...
      }
    ]
}
```
**Response** of `Bob`:

`Bob` will respond with a `CheckStateResponse` 

```json
{
  "spendable": Array[bool],
  "pending": Array[bool]
}
```

Where `[bool]` is an array of booleans indicating whether the provided `Proof` is still spendable. **Important:** The list of booleans MUST be in the same order as the proofs provided by `Alice` in the request.
