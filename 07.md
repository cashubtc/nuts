NUT-07: Token state check
==========================

`optional`

---

With the token state check, wallets can ask the mint whether a specific proof is already spent and whether it is in-flight in a transaction. Wallets can also request the witness data that was used to spend a proof.

### Token states 

A proof can be in one of the following states
- A proof is `UNSPENT` if it has not been spent yet
- A proof is `PENDING` if it is being processed in a transaction (in an ongoing payment). A `PENDING` proof cannot be used in another transaction until it is `live` again.
- A proof is `SPENT` if it has been redeemed and its secret is in the list of spent secrets of the mint.

**Note:** Before deleting spent proofs from their database, wallets can check if the proof is `SPENT` to make sure that they don't accidentally delete an unspent proof. Beware that this behavior can make it easier for the mint to correlate the sender to the receiver.

**Important:** Mints **MUST** remember which proofs are currently `PENDING` to avoid reuse of the same token in multiple concurrent transactions. This can be achieved with for example mutex lock whose key is the proof's `secret`.

## Use cases

#### Example 1: Ecash transaction 
When `Alice` prepares a token to be sent to `Carol`, she can mark these tokens in her database as *pending*. She can then, periodically or upon user input, check with the mint if the token is `UNSPENT` or whether it has been redeemed by `Carol` already, i.e., is `SPENT`. If the proof is not spendable anymore (and, thus, has been redeemed by `Carol`), she can safely delete the proof from her database.

#### Example 2: Lightning payments 
If `Alice`'s melt operation takes a long time to complete (for example if she requests a very slow Lightning payment) and she closes her wallet in the meantime, the next time she comes online, she can check all proofs marked as *pending* in her database to determine whether the payment is still in flight (mint returns `PENDING`), it has succeeded (mint returns `SPENT`), or it has failed (mint returns `UNSPENT`).

## Example

**Request** of `Alice`:

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/checkstate
```

With the data being of the form `PostCheckStateRequest`:

```json
{
  "secrets": [
    <secret_str>,
    ...
  ]
}
```

`secret_str` corresponds to `secret` of the `Proof` to check (see [NUT-00][00]).

**Response** of `Bob`:

`Bob` will respond with a `PostCheckStateResponse` 

```json
{
  "states": [
    {
      "secret": <str>,
      "state": <str_enum[STATE]>,
      "witness": <str|null>,
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

- `secret` corresponds to the proof to check in the request. 

- `state` is an enum string field with possible values `"UNSPENT"`, `"PENDING"`, `"SPENT"`
- `witness` is the serialized witness data that was used to spend the `Proof` if the token required it such as in the case of P2PK (see [NUT-11][11]).

With curl:

**Request** of `Alice`:

```bash
curl -X POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/checkstate -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "secrets": [
    "[\"P2PK\", {\"data\": \"027a0486a237d985cff2dcbec2c7f472136bc0af6399f28881f7fa5eb1a2244c3e\", \"nonce\": \"4a07f7ce5f9a416a67523a643f1944a5\", \"tags\": [[\"locktime\", \"1704459125\"], [\"sigflag\", \"SIG_ALL\"]]}]"
  ]
}'
```

**Response** of `Bob`:

```json
{
  "states": [
    {
      "secret": "[\"P2PK\", {\"data\": \"027a0486a237d985cff2dcbec2c7f472136bc0af6399f28881f7fa5eb1a2244c3e\", \"nonce\": \"4a07f7ce5f9a416a67523a643f1944a5\", \"tags\": [[\"locktime\", \"1704459125\"], [\"sigflag\", \"SIG_ALL\"]]}]",
      "state": "SPENT",
      "witness": "{\"signatures\": [\"c92521e6922da68dbb05b7fb3f3c8004707d57d4379c021e97a9505d875ca100020f85493595578f66e950f383a7671b5d8edaefff5aadb379934cb524744023\"]}"
    }
  ]
}
```


Where `secret` belongs to the provided `Proof` to check in the request, `state` indicates its state, and `witness` is the witness data that was potentially provided in a previous spend operation (can be empty).
