NUT-07: Token state check
==========================

`optional` `author: calle` `author: tb`

---

With the token state check, wallets can ask the mint whether a specific proof is already spent (`spendable`) and whether it is in-flight in a transaction (`pending`). Both of these attributes are returned as sepearte lists of booleans.

### Token states 

A wallet can internally represent the combination of these booleans the proof's `state`. A proof can either be `live` (`spendable == true && pending == false`), `burned` (`spendable == false && pending == (true || false)`), or `in-flight` (`spendable == true && pending == true`).

- A proof is `live` if it has been minted but not spent yet.
- A proof is `burned` if it has been redeemed and its secret is in the list of spent secrets of the mint.
- A proof is `in-flight` if it is being processed in a transaction (in an ongoing payment). An `in-flight` proof cannot be used in another transaction until it is `live` again.

**Important:** Before deleting spent proofs from their database, wallets **MUST** check if the proof is still `spendable` to make sure that they don't delete an unspent proof by accident.

**Note:** Mints **MUST** remember which proofs are currently `pending` to avoid reuse of the same token in multiple concurrent transactions. This can be achieved with a mutex whose key is the proof's `secret`.

## Use cases

#### Example 1: Ecash transaction 
When `Alice` prepares a token to be sent to `Carol`, she can mark these tokens in her database as *pending*. She can then, periodically or upon user input, check with the mint if the token is still spendable (mint returns `True` for `spendable`) or whether it has been redeemed by `Carol` already (mint retrns `False` for `spendable`). If the proof is not spendable anymore (and, thus, has been redeemed by `Carol`), she can safely delete the proof from her database.

#### Example 2: Lightning payments 
If `Alice` pays a very slow Lightning invoice (for example a HODL invoice) and closes her wallet in the meantime, the next time she comes online, she can check all proof marked as *pending* in her database to determine, whether the payment is still in flight (mint returns `True` for `pending` and `spendable`), it has succeeded (mint returns `False` for `pending` and `spendable`), or it has failed (mint returns `False` for `pending` and `True` for `spendable`).

## Example

**Request** of `Alice`:

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/check
```

With the data being of the form `CheckStateRequest`:

```json
{
  "proofs": Proofs
}
```

`Proofs` is a list (array) of `Proof`s (see [NUT-0][00]). `Alice` **CAN** provide a full `Proof` but **MUST** provide at least the `secret` (which is the only thing that `Bob` needs to check whether the token has been spent).

With curl:

```bash
curl -X POST https://mint.host:3338/check -d \
{
  "proofs": 
    [
      {
        "secret": "S+tDfc1Lfsrb06zaRdVTed6Izg"
      },
      {
      ...
      }
    ]
}
```
**Response** of `Bob`:

`Bob` will respond with a `CheckStateResponse` 

```json
{
  "spendable": Array[bool],
  "pending": Array[bool]
}
```

Where `[bool]` is an array of booleans indicating whether the provided `Proof` is still spendable or pending. 

**Important:** The list of booleans **MUST** be in the same order as the proofs provided by `Alice` in the request.
