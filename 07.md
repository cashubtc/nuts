NUT-07: Spendable check
==========================

`optional` `author: calle`

---

With the spendable check, wallets can ask the mint whether a specific token is already spent. This can be useful for different reasons. For example, when `Alice` prepares a token to be sent to `Carol`, she can mark these tokens in her database as *pending*. She can then, periodically or upon user input, check with the mint, if the token is still spendable or if it has been redeemed by `Carol` already (thus not spendable anymore). Another use case is for wallets that want to delete spent proofs from their database. Before deleting a proof, a wallet can check if the token is still spendable to be sure that they don't delete an unspent token by accident.

## Example

**Request** of `Alice`:

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/check
```

With the data being of the form `CheckSpendableRequest`:

```json
{
  "proofs": Proofs
}
```

`Proofs` is a list (array) of `Proof`s (see [NUT-0][00]). `Alice` CAN provide a full `Proof` but MUST provide at least the `secret` (which is the only thing that `Bob` needs to check whether the token has been spent).

With curl:

```bash
curl -X POST https://mint.host:3338/check -d \
{
  "proofs": 
    [
      {
        "secret": "S+tDfc1Lfsrb06zaRdVTed6Izg"
      },
      {
      ...
      }
    ]
}
```
**Response** of `Bob`:

`Bob` will respond with a `CheckSpendableResponse` 

```json
{
  "spendable": Array[bool]
}
```

Where `[bool]` is an array of booleans indicating whether the provided `Proof` is still spendable. **Important:** The list of booleans MUST be in the same order as the proofs provided by `Alice` in the request.
