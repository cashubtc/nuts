NUT-07: Token state check
==========================

`optional`

---

With the token state check, wallets can ask the mint whether a specific proof is already spent (`spendable`) and whether it is in-flight in a transaction (`pending`). Both of these attributes are returned as separate lists of booleans.

### Token states 

A wallet can internally represent the combination of these booleans the proof's `state`. A proof can either be `live` (`spendable == true && pending == false`), `burned` (`spendable == false && pending == (true || false)`), or `in-flight` (`spendable == true && pending == true`).

- A proof is `live` if it has been minted but not spent yet.
- A proof is `burned` if it has been redeemed and its secret is in the list of spent secrets of the mint.
- A proof is `in-flight` if it is being processed in a transaction (in an ongoing payment). An `in-flight` proof cannot be used in another transaction until it is `live` again.

**Note:** Before deleting spent proofs from their database, wallets can check if the proof is still `spendable` to make sure that they don't accidentally delete an unspent proof. Beware that this behavior can make it easier for the mint to correlate the sender to the receiver.

**Important:** Mints **MUST** remember which proofs are currently `pending` to avoid reuse of the same token in multiple concurrent transactions. This can be achieved with for example mutex lock whose key is the proof's `secret`.

## Use cases

#### Example 1: Ecash transaction 
When `Alice` prepares a token to be sent to `Carol`, she can mark these tokens in her database as *pending*. She can then, periodically or upon user input, check with the mint if the token is still spendable (mint returns `True` for `spendable`) or whether it has been redeemed by `Carol` already (mint returns `False` for `spendable`). If the proof is not spendable anymore (and, thus, has been redeemed by `Carol`), she can safely delete the proof from her database.

#### Example 2: Lightning payments 
If `Alice`'s melt operation takes a long time to complete (for example if she requests a very slow Lightning payment) and she closes her wallet in the meantime, the next time she comes online, she can check all proofs marked as *pending* in her database to determine whether the payment is still in flight (mint returns `True` for `pending` and `spendable`), it has succeeded (mint returns `False` for `pending` and `spendable`), or it has failed (mint returns `False` for `pending` and `True` for `spendable`).

## Example

**Request** of `Alice`:

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/check
```

With the data being of the form `CheckStateRequest`:

```json
{
  "proofs": <Array[Proof]>
}
```

Where `proofs` is an array of `Proof`s (see [NUT-00][00]). `Alice` **CAN** provide a full `Proof` but **MUST** provide at least the `secret` (which is the recommended way).

With curl:

```bash
curl -X POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/check -d \
{
  "proofs": 
    [
      {
        "secret": "429700b812a58436be2629af8731a31a37fce54dbf8cbbe90b3f8553179d23f5"
      },
      ...
    ]
}
```
**Response** of `Bob`:

`Bob` will respond with a `CheckStateResponse` 

```json
{
  "spendable": <Array[bool]>,
  "pending": <Array[bool]>
}
```

Where `[bool]` is an array of booleans indicating whether the provided `Proof` is still spendable or pending. 

**Important:** The list of booleans **MUST** be in the same order as the proofs provided by `Alice` in the request.
