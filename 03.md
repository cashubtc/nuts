NUT-03: Swap tokens
==========================

`mandatory`

---

The swap operation is the most important component of the Cashu system. A swap operation consists of multiple inputs (`Proofs`) and outputs (`BlindedMessages`). Mints verify and invalidate the inputs and issue new promises (`BlindSignatures`). These are then used by the wallet to generate new `Proofs` (see [NUT-00][00]).

The swap operation can serve multiple use cases. The first use case is that `Alice` can use it to split her tokens to a target amount she needs to send to `Carol`, if she does not have the necessary amounts to compose the target amount in her wallet already. The second one is that `Carols`'s wallet can use it to receive tokens from `Alice` by sending them as inputs to the mint and receive new outputs in return. 

## 6.1 - Swap to send

To make this more clear, we present an example of a typical case of sending tokens from `Alice` to `Carol`.

`Alice` has 64 sat in her wallet, composed of two `Proofs`, one worth 32 sat and another two worth 16 sat. She wants to send `Carol` 40 sat but does not have the necessary `Proofs` to compose the target amount of 40 sat. For that, `Alice` requests a swap from the mint and uses `Proofs` worth `[16, 16, 32]` as inputs and asks for new outputs worth `[8, 32, 8, 16]` totalling 40 sat. Notice that the first two tokens can now be combined to 40 sat. The `Proofs` that `Alice` sent `Bob` as inputs of the swap operation are now invalidated.

Note: In order to preserve privacy around the amount that a client might want to send to another user and keep the rest as change, the client **SHOULD** ensure that the list requested outputs is ordered by amount in ascending order. As an example of what to avoid, a request for outputs expressed like so: `[16, 8, 2, 64, 8]` might imply the client is preparing a payment for 26 sat; the client should instead order the list like so: `[2, 8, 8, 16, 64]` to mitigate this privacy leak to the mint.


## 6.2 - Swap to receive

Another useful case for the swap operation follows up the example above where `Alice` has swapped her `Proofs` ready to be sent to `Carol`. `Carol` can receive these `Proofs` using the same operation by using them as inputs to invalidate them and request new outputs from `Bob`. Only if `Carol` has redeemed new outputs, `Alice` can't double-spend the `Proofs` anymore and the transaction is settled. To continue our example, `Carol` requests a swap with input `Proofs` worth `[32, 8]` to receive new outputs (of an arbitrary distribution) with the same total amount.

## Example

**Request** of `Alice`:

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/swap
```

With the data being of the form `PostSwapRequest`:

```json
{
  "inputs": <Array[Proof]>,
  "outputs": <Array[BlindedMessage]>,
}
```

With curl:

```bash
curl -X POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/swap -d \
{
  "inputs": 
    [
      {
        "amount": 2,
        "id": "009a1f293253e41e",
        "secret": "407915bc212be61a77e3e6d2aeb4c727980bda51cd06a6afc29e2861768a7837",
        "C": "02bc9097997d81afb2cc7346b5e4345a9346bd2a506eb7958598a72f0cf85163ea"
      },
      {
      ...
      }
    ],
  "outputs":
    [
      {
        "amount": 2, 
        "id": "009a1f293253e41e",
        "B_": "02634a2c2b34bec9e8a4aba4361f6bf202d7fa2365379b0840afe249a7a9d71239"
      },
      {
      ...
      }
    ],
}
```

If successful, `Bob` will respond with a `PostSwapResponse` 

```json
{
  "signatures": <Array[BlindSignature]>
}
```
