NUT-08: Lightning fee return
==========================

`optional` `author: calle` `author: semisol`

---

This document describes how the overpaid Lightning fees are handled and extends [NUT-05][05] which describes melting tokens (i.e. paying a Lightning invoice). In short, a wallet includes *blank outputs* when paying a Lightning invoice which can be assigned a value by the mint if the user has overpaid Lightning fees. This can be the case due to the unpredictability of Lightning network fees. To solve this issue, we introduce so-called *blank outputs* which are blinded messages with an undetermined value. 

The problem is also described in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/callebtc/a6cc0bd2b6f70e081e478147c40fc578).

## Description

Before requesting a Lightning payment as described in [NUT-05][05], `Alice` produces a number of `BlindedMessage` which are similar to ordinary blinded messages but their value is yet to be determined by the mint `Bob` and are thus called *blank outputs*. The number of necessary blank outputs is `max(ceil(log2(fee_reserve)), 1)` which ensures that there is at least one output if there is any fee. If the `fee_reserve` is `0`, then the number of blank outputs is `0` as well. The blank outputs will contain the overpaid fees that will be returned by the mint to the wallet. 

This code calculates the number of necessary blank outputs in Python:

```python
def calculate_number_of_blank_outputs(fee_reserve_sat: int) -> int:
    assert fee_reserve_sat >= 0, "Fee reserve can't be negative."
    if fee_reserve_sat == 0:
        return 0
    return max(math.ceil(math.log2(fee_reserve_sat)), 1)
```

## Example

The wallet wants to pay an invoice with `amount := 100 000 sat` and determines by asking the mint that `fee_reserve` is `1000 sats`. The wallet then provides `101 000 sat` worth of proofs and 10 blank `outputs` to make the payment (since `ceil(log2(1000))=ceil(9.96..)=10`). The mint pays the invoice and determines that the actual fee was `100 sat`, i.e, the overpaid fee to return is `fee_return = 900 sat`. The mint splits the amount `900` into summands of `2^n` which is `4, 128, 256, 512`. The mint inserts these amounts into the blank `outputs` it received form the wallet and generates 4 new promises. The mint then returns these `BlindedSignature`s to the wallet together with the successful payment status.

## Wallet flow
The wallet asks the mint for the `fee_reserve` for paying a specific bolt11 invoice of value `amount` by calling `POST /v1/melt/quote` as described in [NUT-05][05]. The wallet then provides a `PostMeltBolt11Request` to `POST /v1/melt/bolt11` that has (1) proofs of the value `amount+fee_reserve`, (2) the bolt11 invoice to be paid, and finally, as a new entry, (3) a field `outputs` that has `n_blank_outputs` blinded messages that are generated before the payment attempt to receive potential overpaid fees back to her.

## Mint flow

Here we describe how the mint generates `BlindedSignature`s for the overpaid fees. The mint `Bob` returns in `PostMeltBolt11Response` the field `change` **ONLY IF** `Alice` has previously provided `outputs` for the change **AND** if the Lightning `actual_fees` were smaller than the `fee_reserve`.

If the `overpaid_fees = fee_reserve - actual_fees` is positive, `Bob` decomposes it to values of `2^n` (as in [NUT-00][00]) and then imprints them into the `blank_outputs` provided by `Alice`. 

`Bob` then signs these blank outputs (now with the imprinted amounts) and thus generates `BlindedSignature`s. `Bob` then returns a payment status to the wallet, and, in addition, all blind signatures it generated for the overpaid fees.

Importantly, while `Bob` does not necessarily return the same number of blind signatures as it received blank outputs from `Alice` (since some of them may be of value 0), `Bob` **MUST** return the all blank signatures with a value greater than 0 in the same order as the blank outputs were received and should omit all blind signatures with value 0. For example, if `Bob` receives 10 blank outputs but the overpaid fees only occupy 4 blind signatures, `Bob` will only return these 4 blind signatures with the appropriate imprinted amounts and omit the remaining 6 blind signatures with value 0. Due to the well-defined order of the returned blind signatures, `Alice` can map the blind signatures returned from `Bob` to the blank outputs it provided so that she can further apply the correct unblinding operations on them.

## Example

**Request** of `Alice`:

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/melt/bolt11
```

With the data being of the form `PostMeltBolt11Request`:

```json
{
  "quote": <str>,
  "inputs": <Array[Proof]>,
  "outputs": <Array[BlindedMessage]> <-- New
}
```
where the new `output` field carries the `BlindMessages`.

The mint `Bob` then responds with a `PostMeltBolt11Response`:

```json
{
  "paid": <bool>,
  "proof": <str>,
  "change": <Array[BlindSignature]> <-- New
}
```
where the new `change` field carries the returned `BlindSignatures` due to overpaid fees.

## Example

Request of `Alice` with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/melt/bolt11 -d \
'{
  "quote": "od4CN5smMMS3K3QVHkbGGNCTxfcAIyIXeq8IrfhP",
  "inputs": [
    {
      "id": "009a1f293253e41e",
      "amount": 4,
      "secret": "429700b812a58436be2629af8731a31a37fce54dbf8cbbe90b3f8553179d23f5",
      "C": "03b01869f528337e161a6768b480fcf9f75fd248b649c382f5e352489fd84fd011",
    },
    {
      "id": "009a1f293253e41e",
      "amount": 8,
      "secret": "4f3155acef6481108fcf354f6d06e504ce8b441e617d30c88924991298cdbcad",
      "C": "0278ab1c1af35487a5ea903b693e96447b2034d0fd6bac529e753097743bf73ca9",
    }
  ],
  "outputs": [
    {
      "amount": 1,
      "id": "009a1f293253e41e",
      "B_": "03327fc4fa333909b70f08759e217ce5c94e6bf1fc2382562f3c560c5580fa69f4"
    }
  ]
}'
```

Everything here is the same as in [NUT-05][05] except for `outputs`. The `amount` field in the `BlindedMessage`s here are ignored by `Bob` so they can be set to any arbitrary value by `Alice` (they should be set to a value, like `1` so potential JSON validations do not error).

If the mint has made a successful payment, it will respond the following.

**Response** `PostMeltBolt11Response` from `Bob`:

```json
{
  "paid": true,
  "proof": "c5a1ae1f639e1f4a3872e81500fd028bece7bedc1152f740cba5c3417b748c1b",
  "change": [
    {
      "id": "009a1f293253e41e",
      "amount": 2,
      "C_": "03c668f551855ddc792e22ea61d32ddfa6a45b1eb659ce66e915bf5127a8657be0",
    }
  ]
}
```
The field `change` is an array of `BlindedSignatures` that account for the overpaid fees. Notice that the amount has been changed by the mint. `Alice` must take these and generate `Proofs` by unblinding them as described in [NUT-00][00] and as she does in [NUT-04][04] when minting new tokens. After generating the `Proofs`, `Alice` stores them in her database.
