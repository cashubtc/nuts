NUT-08: Lightning fee return
==========================

`optional` `author: calle`

---

This document describes how the overpaid Lightning fees are handled and extends [NUT-05][05] which describes melting tokens (i.e. paying a Lightning invoice). In short, a wallet includes *blank outputs* when paying a Lightning invoice which can be assigned a value by the mint if the user has overpaid Lightning fees. This can be the case due to the unpredictability of Lightning network fees. To solve this issue, we introduce so-called *blank outputs* which are blinded messages with an undetermined value. 

The problem is also described in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/callebtc/a6cc0bd2b6f70e081e478147c40fc578).

## Description

Before requesting a Lightning payment as described in [NUT-05][05], `Alice` produces a number of `BlindedMessage` which are similar to ordinary blinded messages but their value is yet to be determined by the mint `Bob` and are thus called *blank outputs*. The amount of blinded outputs is `ceil(log2(fee_reserve))`, which ensures that any amount <= the fee reserve can be returned back by the mint

## Example

The wallet wants to pay an invoice with `amount := 100 000 sats` and determines by asking the mint that `fee_reseve` is `1000 sats`. The wallet then provides `101 000 sats` worth of proofs and 10 blank `outputs` to make the payment. The mint pays the invoice and determines that the actual fee was `100 sat`, i.e, the overpaid fee to return is `fee_return = 900 sats`. The mint splits the amount `900` into summands of `2^n` which is `4, 128, 256, 512`. The mint inserts these amounts into the blank `outputs` it received form the wallet and generates 4 new promises. The mint then returns these `BlindedSignature`'s to the wallet together with the successful payment status.

## Wallet flow
The wallet asks the mint for the `fee_reserve` for paying a specific bolt11 invoice of value `amount` by calling `/checkfees` as described in [NUT-05][05]. The wallet then provides a MeltRequest to `/melt` that has 1. proofs of the value `amount+fee_reserve`, 2. the bolt11 invoice to be paid, and finally, as a new new entry, 3. a field `outputs` that has `n_blank_outputs` blinded messages that are generated before the payment attempt to receive potenaitl overpaid fees back to her.

## Mint flow

Here we describe how the mint generates `BlindedSignature`'s for the overpaid fees. The mint `Bob` returns in `PostMeltResponse` the field `change` **ONLY IF** `Alice` has previously provided `outputs` for the change **AND** if the Lightning `actual_fees` were smaller than the `fee_reserve`.

If the `overpaid_fees = fee_reserve - actual_fees` is positive, `Bob` decomposes it to values of `2^n` (as in [NUT-00][00]) and then imprints them into the `blank_outputs` provided by `Alice`. 

`Bob` then signs these blank outputs (now with the imprinted amounts) and thus generates `BlindedSignature`'s. `Bob` then returns a payment status to the wallet, and, in addition, the up to `n_blank_outputs` blinded signatures it generated for the overpaid fees.

## Example

**Request** of `Alice`:

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/melt
```

With the data being of the form `PostMeltRequest`:

```json
{
  "proofs": 
    [
      Proof,
      ...
    ],
  "invoice": str,
  "outputs": [
      BlindedMessage,
      ...
    ]
}
```

Everything here is the same as in [NUT-05][05] except for `outputs`. The `amount` field in the `BlindedMessage`'s here are ignored by `Bob` so they can be set to any arbitrary value by `Alice` (they should be set to a value, like `1` so potential JSON validations do not error).

If the mint has made a successful payment, it will respond the following.

**Response** `PostMeltResponse` from `Bob`:

```json
{
"paid": true,
"preimage": "da225c115418671b64a67d1d9ea6a...",
"change": [
    BlindedSignature,
    ...
  ]
}
```
The field `change` has a list (array) of `BlindedSignature`'s (or promises) that account for the overpaid fees. `Alice` must take these and generate `Proof`'s from them (unblinding), as described in [NUT-00][00] and as she does in [NUT-04][04] when minting new tokens with the important difference being that the `amount` of each `BlindedSignature` is determined by the mint `Bob` and not in advance by `Alice`. After generating the `Proof`'s, `Alice` stores them in her database.
