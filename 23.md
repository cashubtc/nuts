# NUT-23: Mint tokens via BOLT12

`optional`

`depends on: NUT-20`

---

Similar to [NUT-04][04], which covers minting via BOLT11 invoices, minting via [BOLT12](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/12-offer-encoding.md) is also a two-step process: requesting a mint quote and minting tokens. This document describes both steps, focusing on BOLT12-specific considerations.

# Mint quote

To request a mint quote, the wallet of `Alice` makes a `POST /v1/mint/quote/bolt12`.

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/mint/quote/bolt12
```

The wallet of `Alice` includes the following `PostMintQuoteBolt12Request` data in its request:

```json
{
  "amount": <int|null>,
  "unit": <str_enum["sat"]>,
  "description": <str|null>,
  "expiry": <int|null>,
  "single_use": <bool>,
  "pubkey": <str>
}
```

The `amount` field is optional and specifies the amount to mint. The `unit` field is mandatory. An optional `description` can be passed if the mint signals support for it in `MintMethodSetting`. If `single_use` is false, the offer can be paid multiple times. The optional `expiry` field specifies the unix timestamp when the offer expires it **MUST** be before the `max_expiry` in the `MintMethodSettings` if one is given. `pubkey` is the public key that will be required for signature verification during the minting process. The mint will only mint ecash after receiving a valid signature from the corresponding private key in the `PostMintRequest`.

> **Note:** While a pubkey is optinal as per [NUT-20][20] for [NUT-04][04] it is required in this NUT and the mint **MUST NOT** issue a mint quote if one is not included.

> **Privacy:** To prevent linking multiple mint quotes together, wallets **SHOULD** generate a unique public key for each mint quote request

The mint `Bob` then responds with a `PostMintQuoteBolt12Response`:

```json
{
  "quote": <str>,
  "request": <str>,
  "amount": <int|null>,
  "unit": <str_enum["sat"]>,
  "expiry": <int|null>,
  "single_use": <bool>,
  "pubkey": <str>,
  "amount_paid": <int>,
  "amount_issued": <int>,
}
```

Where `quote` is the quote ID and `request` is the bolt12 offer. `expiry` is the Unix timestamp until which the mint quote is valid. `amount_paid` is the amount that has been paid to the mint via the bolt12 offer. `amount_issued` is the amount of ecash that has been issued for the given mint quote. `amount_paid` - `amount_issued` represents the amount of ecash a wallet can still mint.

## Example

Request of `Alice` with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3338/v1/mint/quote/bolt12 -d '{"amount": 10, "unit": "sat", "single_use": true, "pubkey": "03d56ce4e446a85bbdaa547b4ec2b073d40ff802831352b8272b7dd7a4de5a7cac"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Response of `Bob`:

```json
{
  "quote": "DSGLX9kevM...",
  "request": "lno1qcp...",
  "amount": 10,
  "unit": "sat",
  "expiry": 1701704757,
  "single_use": true,
  "pubkey": "03d56ce4e446a85bbdaa547b4ec2b073d40ff802831352b8272b7dd7a4de5a7cac",
  "amount_paid": 0,
  "amount_issued": 0
}
```

After payment, the wallet continues with the next section.

## Check mint quote

To check whether a mint quote has been paid and has ecash that can be issued, `Alice` makes a `GET /v1/mint/quote/bolt12/{quote_id}`.

```http
GET https://mint.host:3338/v1/mint/quote/bolt12/{quote_id}
```

The mint `Bob` responds with a `PostMintQuoteBolt12Response`.

Example request of `Alice` with curl:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3338/v1/mint/quote/bolt12/DSGLX9kevM...
```

#### Signature

In order to mint ecash the wallet **MUST** include a signature as defined in [NUT-20][20].

# Minting tokens

After requesting a mint quote and paying the request, the wallet proceeds with minting new tokens by calling `POST /v1/mint/bolt12`.

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/mint/bolt12
```

The wallet `Alice` includes the following `PostMintBolt12Request` data in its request:

```json
{
  "quote": <str>,
  "outputs": <Array[BlindedMessage]>,
  "signature": <str>
}
```

The `quote` is the quote ID from the previous step and `outputs` are `BlindedMessages` (see [NUT-00][00]) that the wallet requests signatures on. The sum of the outputs **SHOULD** equal the amount that can be minted (`amount_paid` - `amount_issued`) but **MUST NOT** be more than that amount. `signature` is the signature on the mint quote id as defined in [NUT-20][20].

The mint `Bob` then responds with a `PostMintBolt12Response`:

```json
{
  "signatures": <Array[BlindSignature]>
}
```

where `signatures` is an array of blind signatures on the outputs.

## Multiple issuances

Unlike BOLT11 invoices, BOLT12 offers can be paid multiple times as long as the `single_use` flag is false. This allows the wallet to mint multiple times for one quote. The wallet can call the check bolt12 endpoint, where the mint will return the `PostMintQuoteBolt12Response` including `amount_paid` and `amount_issued`. The difference between these values represents how much the wallet can mint by calling the mint endpoint as defined above.

## Settings

The settings for this nut indicate the supported method-unit pairs for minting and whether minting is disabled or not. They are part of the info response of the mint ([NUT-06][06]) which in this case reads:

```json
{
  "23": {
    "methods": [
      <MintMethodSetting>,
      ...
    ],
    "disabled": <bool>
  }
}
```

`MintMethodSetting` indicates supported `method` and `unit` pairs and additional settings of the mint. `disabled` indicates whether this minting is disabled.

`MintMethodSetting` is of the form:

```json
{
  "method": <str>,
  "unit": <str>,
  "min_amount": <int|null>,
  "max_amount": <int|null>,
  "description": <bool|null>,
  "max_expiry": <int|null>
}
```

`min_amount` and `max_amount` define the allowed range for transactions using this method-unit pair. `max_expiry` specifies the latest timestamp (in Unix time) until which payments for this offer will be accepted.

Example `MintMethodSetting`:

```json
{
  "method": "bolt12",
  "unit": "sat",
  "min_amount": 0,
  "max_amount": 10000,
  "description": true,
  "max_expiry": 1825076378
}
```

# WebSocket support

In addition to HTTP endpoints, BOLT12 mints can also provide real-time updates via WebSockets as defined in [NUT-17][17]. This allows wallets to receive notifications about the state changes of BOLT12 mint quotes.

## Subscriptions

The websocket enables real-time subscriptions that wallets can use to receive notifications for state changes of a `PostMintQuoteBolt12Response`.

To subscribe to updates for BOLT12 mint quotes, the wallet can use the `bolt12_mint_quote` subscription kind in the WebSocket subscription request:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 0,
  "method": "subscribe",
  "params": {
    "kind": "bolt12_mint_quote",
    "filters": ["DSGLX9kevM..."],
    "subId": "Ua_IYvRHoCoF_wsZFlJ1m4gBDB--O0_6_n0zHg2T"
  }
}
```

Where `filters` contains the BOLT12 mint quote IDs that the wallet wants to subscribe to.

## Mint info setting

Mints signal WebSocket support for BOLT12 via [NUT-06][06] in the `nuts.17` section of their info response:

```json
"nuts": {
  "17": {
    "supported": [
      {
        "method": "bolt12",
        "unit": "sat",
        "commands": [
          "bolt12_mint_quote",
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Where `commands` includes `bolt12_mint_quote` to indicate support for BOLT12 mint quote WebSocket notifications.
