# NUT-24: Melt tokens via BOLT12

`optional`

Similar to [NUT-05][05], which covers melting via BOLT11 invoices, melting via [BOLT12](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/12-offer-encoding.md) is also a two-step process: requesting a melt quote and melting tokens. This document describes both steps, focusing on BOLT12-specific considerations.

# Melt quote

To request a melt quote, the wallet of `Alice` makes a `POST /v1/melt/quote/bolt12`..

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/melt/quote/bolt12
```

The wallet `Alice` includes the following `PostMeltQuoteBolt12Request` data in its request:

```json
{
  "request": <str>,
  "unit": <str_enum["sat"]>,
  "options": { // Optional
    "amountless": {
      "amount_msat": <int>
    }
  }
}
```

Here, `request` is the bolt12 Offer to be paid and `unit` is the unit the wallet would like to pay with. For amount-less offers, the `options.amountless.amount_msat` field can be used to specify the amount in millisatoshis to pay to the offer. If both `options.amountless.amount_msat` is defined and the offer has an amount, they **MUST** be equal.

The mint `Bob` then responds with a `PostMeltQuoteBolt12Response`:

```json
{
  "quote": <str>,
  "amount": <int>,
  "fee_reserve": <int>,
  "state": <str_enum[STATE]>,
  "expiry": <int>,
  "payment_preimage": <str|null>
}
```

Where `quote` is the quote ID, `amount` the amount that needs to be provided, and `fee_reserve` the additional fee reserve that is required. The mint expects `Alice` to include `Proofs` of _at least_ `total_amount = amount + fee_reserve`. `expiry` is the Unix timestamp until which the melt quote is valid. `payment_preimage` is the payment preimage in case of a successful payment.

`state` is an enum string field with possible values `"UNPAID"`, `"PENDING"`, `"PAID"`:

- `"UNPAID"` means that the request has not been paid yet.
- `"PENDING"` means that the request is currently being paid.
- `"PAID"` means that the request has been paid successfully.

## Example

Request of `Alice` with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/melt/quote/bolt12 -d \
{
  "request": "lno1zrxq8pjw7qjlm68mtp7e3y...",
  "unit": "sat"
}
```

Response of `Bob`:

```json
{
  "quote": "TRmjduhIsPxd...",
  "amount": 10,
  "fee_reserve": 2,
  "state": "UNPAID",
  "expiry": 1701704757
}
```

## Check melt quote state

To check whether a melt quote has been paid, `Alice` makes a `GET /v1/melt/quote/bolt12/{quote_id}`.

```http
GET https://mint.host:3338/v1/melt/quote/bolt12/{quote_id}
```

Like before, the mint `Bob` responds with a `PostMeltQuoteBolt12Response`.

Example request of `Alice` with curl:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3338/v1/melt/quote/bolt12/TRmjduhIsPxd...
```

# Melting tokens

Now that `Alice` knows what the total amount is (`amount + fee_reserve`) in her requested `unit`, she can proceed to melting tokens for which a payment will be executed by the mint. She calls the `POST /v1/melt/bolt12`.

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/melt/bolt12
```

⚠️ **Attention:** This call will block until the Lightning payment either succeeds or fails. This can take quite a long time in case the Lightning payment is slow. Make sure to **use no (or a very long) timeout when making this call**!

The wallet of `Alice` includes the following `PostMeltBolt12Request` data in its request

```json
{
  "quote": <str>,
  "inputs": <Array[Proof]>
}
```

Here, `quote` is the melt quote ID to be paid and `inputs` are the proofs with a total amount of at least `amount + fee_reserve` (see previous melt quote response).

Like before, the mint `Bob` then responds with a `PostMeltQuoteBolt12Response`. If the payment was successful, the `state` field is set to `"PAID"` and the response includes the `payment_preimage` field containing the payment secret of the bolt11 payment.

If `state=="PAID"`, `Alice`'s wallet can delete the `inputs` from her database (or move them to a history). If `state=="UNPAID"`, `Alice` can repeat the same request again until the payment is successful.

## Example

Request of `Alice` with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/melt/bolt12 -d \
'{
  "quote": "od4CN5smMMS3K3QVHkbGGNCTxfcAIyIXeq8IrfhP",
  "inputs": [
    {
      "amount": 4,
      "id": "009a1f293253e41e",
      "secret": "429700b812a58436be2629af8731a31a37fce54dbf8cbbe90b3f8553179d23f5",
      "C": "03b01869f528337e161a6768b480fcf9f75fd248b649c382f5e352489fd84fd011",
    },
    {
      "amount": 8,
      "id": "009a1f293253e41e",
      "secret": "4f3155acef6481108fcf354f6d06e504ce8b441e617d30c88924991298cdbcad",
      "C": "0278ab1c1af35487a5ea903b693e96447b2034d0fd6bac529e753097743bf73ca9",
    }
  ]
}'
```

Response `PostMeltQuoteBolt12Response` of `Bob`:

```json
{
  "quote": "TRmjduhIsPxd...",
  "amount": 10,
  "fee_reserve": 2,
  "state": "PAID",
  "expiry": 1701704757,
  "payment_preimage": "c5a1ae1f639e1f4a3872e81500fd028bece7bedc1152f740cba5c3417b748c1b"
}
```

## Settings

The mint's settings for this nut indicate the supported method-unit pairs for melting. They are part of the info response of the mint ([NUT-06][06]) which in this case reads

```json
{
  "24": {
    "methods": [
      <MeltMethodSetting>,
      ...
    ],
    "disabled": <bool>
  }
}
```

`MeltMethodSetting` indicates supported `method` and `unit` pairs and additional settings of the mint. `disabled` indicates whether melting is disabled.

`MeltMethodSetting` is of the form:

```json
{
  "method": <str>,
  "unit": <str>,
  "min_amount": <int|null>,
  "max_amount": <int|null>
}
```

`min_amount` and `max_amount` indicate the minimum and maximum amount for an operation of this method-unit pair.

Example `MeltMethodSetting`:

```json
{
  "method": "bolt12",
  "unit": "sat",
  "min_amount": 100,
  "max_amount": 10000
}
```

# WebSocket support

In addition to HTTP endpoints, BOLT12 mints can also provide real-time updates via WebSockets as defined in [NUT-17][17]. This allows wallets to receive notifications about the state changes of BOLT12 melt quotes.

## Subscriptions

The websocket enables real-time subscriptions that wallets can use to receive notifications for state changes of a `PostMeltQuoteBolt12Response`.

To subscribe to updates for BOLT12 melt quotes, the wallet can use the `bolt12_melt_quote` subscription kind in the WebSocket subscription request:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 0,
  "method": "subscribe",
  "params": {
    "kind": "bolt12_melt_quote",
    "filters": ["TRmjduhIsPxd..."],
    "subId": "Eb_KJdvQI7lM_yjaBzF2p9fRTH--P1_7_n0aXh8T"
  }
}
```

Where `filters` contains the BOLT12 melt quote IDs that the wallet wants to subscribe to.

## Mint info setting

Mints signal WebSocket support for BOLT12 melting via [NUT-06][06] in the `nuts.17` section of their info response:

```json
"nuts": {
  "17": {
    "supported": [
      {
        "method": "bolt12",
        "unit": "sat",
        "commands": [
          "bolt12_melt_quote",
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Where `commands` includes `bolt12_melt_quote` to indicate support for BOLT12 melt quote WebSocket notifications.
