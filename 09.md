NUT-09: Restore signatures
==========================

`optional` `used in: NUT-13`

---

In this document, we describe how wallets can recover blind signatures, and with that their corresponding `Proofs`, by requesting from the mint to reissue the blind signatures. This can be used for a backup recovery of a lost wallet (see [NUT-09][09]) or for recovering the response of an interrupted swap request (see [NUT-03][03]).

Mints must store the `BlindedMessage` and the corresponding `BlindSignature` in their database every time they issue a `BlindSignature`. Wallets provide the `BlindedMessage` for which they request the `BlindSignature`. Mints only respond with a `BlindSignature`, if they have previously signed the `BlindedMessage`. Each returned `BlindSignature` also contains the `amount` and the keyset `id` (see [NUT-00][00]) which is all the necessary information for a wallet to recover a `Proof`.

**Request** of `Alice`:

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/restore
```

With the data being of the form `PostRestoreRequest`:

```json
{
  "outputs": <Array[BlindedMessages]>
}
```

**Response** of `Bob`: 

The mint `Bob` then responds with a `PostRestoreResponse`.

```json
{
  "outputs": <Array[BlindedMessages]>,
  "signatures": <Array[BlindSignature]>
}
```

The returned arrays `outputs` and `signatures` are of the same length and for every entry `outputs[i]`, there is a corresponding entry `signatures[i]`.
