# NUT-20: Signature on Mint Quote

`optional`

`depends on: NUT-04`

---

This NUT defines signature-based authentication for mint quote redemption. When requesting a mint quote, clients provide a public key. The mint will then require a valid signature from the corresponding secret key to process the mint operation.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> [NUT-04][04] mint quotes without a public key can be minted by anyone who knows the mint quote id without providing a signature.

## Mint quote

To request a mint quote, the wallet of `Alice` makes a `POST /v1/mint/quote/{method}` request where `method` is the payment method requested. We present an example with the `method` being `bolt11` here.

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/mint/quote/bolt11
```

The wallet of `Alice` includes the following `PostMintQuoteBolt11Request` data in its request:

```json
{
  "amount": <int>,
  "unit": <str_enum["sat"]>,
  "description": <str>, // Optional
  "pubkey": <str> // Optional <-- New
}
```

with the requested `amount`,`unit`, and `description` according to [NUT-04][04].

`pubkey` is the public key that will be required for signature verification during the minting operation. The mint will only mint ecash after receiving a valid signature from the corresponding private key in the subsequent `PostMintRequest`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **Privacy:** To prevent the mint from being able to link multiple mint quotes, wallets **SHOULD** generate a unique public key for each mint quote request.

The mint `Bob` then responds with a `PostMintQuoteBolt11Response`:

```json
{
  "quote": <str>,
  "request": <str>,
  "state": <str_enum[STATE]>,
  "expiry": <int>,
  "pubkey": <str> // Optional <-- New
}
```

The response is the same as in [NUT-04][04] except for `pubkey` which has been provided by the wallet in the previous request.

## Example

Request of `Alice` with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3338/v1/mint/quote/bolt11 -d '{"amount": 10, "unit": "sat", "pubkey": "03d56ce4e446a85bbdaa547b4ec2b073d40ff802831352b8272b7dd7a4de5a7cac"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Response of `Bob`:

```json
{
  "quote": "9d745270-1405-46de-b5c5-e2762b4f5e00",
  "request": "lnbc100n1pj4apw9...",
  "state": "UNPAID",
  "expiry": 1701704757,
  "pubkey": "03d56ce4e446a85bbdaa547b4ec2b073d40ff802831352b8272b7dd7a4de5a7cac"
}
```

## Signing the mint request

### Message aggregation

To provide a signature for a mint request, the owner of the signing public keys must concatenate the quote ID `quote` in `PostMintQuoteBolt11Response` and the `B_` fields of all `BlindedMessages` in the `PostMintBolt11Request` (i.e., the outputs, see [NUT-00][00]) to a single message string in the order they appear in the `PostMintRequest`. This concatenated string is then hashed and signed (see [Signature scheme](#signature-scheme)).

> [!NOTE]
>
> Concatenating the quote ID and the outputs into a single message prevents maliciously replacing the outputs.

If a request has `n` outputs, the message to sign becomes:

```
msg_to_sign =  quote || B_0 || ... || B_(n-1)
```

Where `||` denotes concatenation, `quote` is the UTF-8 quote id in `PostMintQuoteBolt11Response`, and each `B_n` is a UTF-8 encoded hex string of the outputs in the `PostMintBolt11Request`.

### Signature scheme

To mint a quote where a public key was provided, the wallet includes a signature on `msg_to_sign` in the `PostMintBolt11Request`. We use a [BIP340](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340.mediawiki) Schnorr signature on the SHA-256 hash of the message to sign as defined above.

## Minting tokens

After requesting a mint quote and paying the request, the wallet proceeds with minting new tokens by calling the `POST /v1/mint/{method}` endpoint where `method` is the payment method requested (here `bolt11`).

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/mint/bolt11
```

The wallet `Alice` includes the following `PostMintBolt11Request` data in its request

```json
{
  "quote": <str>,
  "outputs": <Array[BlindedMessage]>,
  "signature": <str|null> <-- New
}
```

with the `quote` being the quote ID from the previous step and `outputs` being `BlindedMessages` as in [NUT-04][04].

`signature` is the signature on the `msg_to_sign` which is the concatenated quote id and the outputs as defined above.

The mint responds with a `PostMintBolt11Response` as in [NUT-04][04] if all validations are successful.

## Example

Request of `Alice` with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/mint/bolt11 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
'{
  "quote": "9d745270-1405-46de-b5c5-e2762b4f5e00",
  "outputs": [
    {
      "amount": 8,
      "id": "009a1f293253e41e",
      "B_": "035015e6d7ade60ba8426cefaf1832bbd27257636e44a76b922d78e79b47cb689d"
    },
    {
      "amount": 2,
      "id": "009a1f293253e41e",
      "B_": "0288d7649652d0a83fc9c966c969fb217f15904431e61a44b14999fabc1b5d9ac6"
    }
  ],
  "signature": "d9be080b33179387e504bb6991ea41ae0dd715e28b01ce9f63d57198a095bccc776874914288e6989e97ac9d255ac667c205fa8d90a211184b417b4ffdd24092"

}'
```

Response of `Bob`:

```json
{
  "signatures": [
    {
      "id": "009a1f293253e41e",
      "amount": 2,
      "C_": "0224f1c4c564230ad3d96c5033efdc425582397a5a7691d600202732edc6d4b1ec"
    },
    {
      "id": "009a1f293253e41e",
      "amount": 8,
      "C_": "0277d1de806ed177007e5b94a8139343b6382e472c752a74e99949d511f7194f6c"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Errors

If the wallet user `Alice` does not include a signature on the `PostMintBolt11Request` but did include a `pubkey` in the `PostMintBolt11QuoteRequest` then `Bob` **MUST** respond with an error. `Alice` **CAN** repeat the request with a valid signature.

See [Error Codes][errors]:

- `20008`: Mint quote with `pubkey` but no valid `signature` provided for mint request.
- `20009`: Mint quote requires `pubkey` but none given or invalid `pubkey`.

## Quote Lookup by Public Key

Wallets **MAY** retrieve mint quote information by providing the public key(s) used during quote creation. This allows quote recovery when the quote ID is unknown.

### Lookup Request

To lookup quotes by public key, the wallet makes a `POST /v1/mint/quote/lookup` request with the following `PostMintQuoteLookupRequest`:

```json
{
  "pubkeys": [<str>]
}
```

Where `pubkeys` is an array of hex-encoded public keys to lookup quotes for.

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/mint/quote/lookup
```

### Lookup Response

The mint responds with a `PostMintQuoteLookupResponse`:

```json
{
  "quotes": [
    {
      "pubkey": <str>,
      "quote": <str>,
      "request": <str>,
      "state": <str_enum[STATE]>,
      "expiry": <int>,
      "amount": <int>,
      "unit": <str_enum[UNIT]>
    }
  ]
}
```

Where:
- `quotes` is an array of quote objects matching the provided public keys (empty array if no matches)
- `pubkey` is the public key associated with this quote
- `quote` is the quote ID that can be used for minting
- `request` is the payment request (e.g., bolt11 invoice) from the original quote
- `state` is the current state of the quote (UNPAID, PAID, ISSUED)
- `expiry` is the Unix timestamp when the quote expires
- `amount` is the amount associated with the quote
- `unit` is the unit of the quote (e.g., "sat")

### Example

Request with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3338/v1/mint/quote/lookup -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
'{
  "pubkeys": [
    "1a02b9355b1df74574ca1a85ee96f2a8cad9d650aacbec26734f9ba7309b07b2",
    "8d4f72043ca8ccb7dfb62b351e7589ca34b58ffa069834ecb0f069e3e1504c24"
  ]
}'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "quotes": [
    {
      "pubkey": "1a02b9355b1df74574ca1a85ee96f2a8cad9d650aacbec26734f9ba7309b07b2",
      "quote": "85233cdc-02ea-45e6-b96f-dd6dad19d28e",
      "request": "lnbc690n1pn2s0d0pp5...",
      "state": "PAID",
      "expiry": 1754336050,
      "amount": 69,
      "unit": "sat"
    },
    {
      "pubkey": "8d4f72043ca8ccb7dfb62b351e7589ca34b58ffa069834ecb0f069e3e1504c24",
      "quote": "490fd953-89da-441d-b43e-9df6029be769",
      "request": "lnbc4200n1pn2s0d0pp5...", 
      "state": "UNPAID",
      "expiry": 1754336050,
      "amount": 420,
      "unit": "sat"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Lookup Errors

See [Error Codes][errors]:

- `20010`: Invalid public key format provided in lookup request.

## Settings

The settings for this NUT indicate the support for requiring a signature before minting and quote lookup functionality. They are part of the info response of the mint ([NUT-06][06]) which in this case reads

```json
{
  "20": {
    "supported": <bool>,
    "quote_lookup": <bool>
  }
}
```

Where:
- `supported` indicates whether signature-based mint quotes are supported
- `quote_lookup` indicates whether the quote lookup API is available
