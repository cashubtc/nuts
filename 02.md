NUT-02: Keysets and keyset ID
==========================

`mandatory` `author: calle`

---

A keyset is a set of public keys that the mint `Bob` generates and shares with its users. The mint **MUST** use the [compressed public key format](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/public-key#public-key-format). The keyset refers to the set of public keys that each correspond to the amount values that the mint supports (e.g. 1, 2, 4, 8, ...) respectively.

## Requesting mint keyset IDs

A mint can have multiple keysets at the same time but **MUST** have only one *current* keyset (see [NUT-01][01]). Tokens from all other keysets are still accepted but must be redeemed for tokens from only the active keyset.

A wallet can ask the mint for all active keyset IDs via the `GET /keysets` endpoint. A wallet **CAN** request the list of active keyset IDs from the mint upon startup and, if it does so, **MUST** choose only tokens from its database that have a keyset ID supported by the mint to interact with it.

This is useful in the case where a wallet interacts with multiple mints. That way, a wallet always knows which tokens it can use with the mint it is currently interacting with. It also helps wallets to determine whether the mint has rotated to a new current keyset and whether it should recycle all tokens from older keysets to the current one.

## Example

Request of `Alice`:

```http
GET https://mint.host:3338/keysets
```

With curl:

```bash
curl -X GET https://mint.host:3338/keysets
```

Response of `Bob`:

```json
{
  "keysets": [
    {
      "id": "L3zxxRB/I8uE",
      "symbol": "sat",
      "active": True
    },
    {
      "id": "DSAl9nvvyfva",
      "symbol": "sat",
      "active": False
    }
    ...
  ]
}
```

**Note:** The ordering of the entries in the `keysets` field of the response should not be relied on to assume which keyset ID is the most recent one! For a wallet to be sure which keyset is the most recent one, it should request the keys themselves (see [NUT-01][01]) and then compute the keyset ID.

### Mints: Generating a keyset

A keyset is generated by the mint by a single seed `s` from which the private keys `k_i` are derived, with `i` being the index of the amount value. The derivation for the elements `k_i` goes like this:

```python
for i in range(MAX_ORDER):
	k_i = HASH_SHA256(s + D + i)[:32]
```

Here, `MAX_ORDER` refers to the order of the maximum token value that the mint supports, i.e., `2^MAX_ORDER`. Typically, `MAX_ORDER = 64`. `D` refers to a derivation path that is chosen by the mint. The derivation path can be used to rotate keys over time or to service multiple parallel mints with a single instance. `i` is the string representation of the index of the amount value, i.e., `0`, `1`, and so on.

## Keyset ID

A keyset ID is an identifier for a specific keyset. It can be derived by anyone who knows the set of public keys of a mint. The keyset ID is stored in each `Proof` and therefore in a [token][TokenV3] such that the token can be used to identify which mint or keyset it was generated from. 

### Storing the keyset ID in a token

A wallet can use the keyset ID in a token to recognize a mint it was issued by. For example, a wallet might store the `MINT_URL` together with the `keyset_id` in its database the first time it receives a keyset from that mint. That way, a wallet can know which mint to contact when it receives a token with a `keyset_id` of a mint that it has interacted with before.

Note: V3 tokens (see [NUT-00][00]) include the `MINT_URL` to enable the first contact when a wallet receives a token from a mint it has never met before.

### Deriving the keyset ID

The mint and the wallets of its users can derive a keyset ID from the keyset of the mint. To derive the keyset ID of a keyset, execute the following steps:

```
1 - sort keyset by amount
2 - concatenate all (sorted) public keys to one string
3 - HASH_SHA256 the concatenated public keys
4 - take the first 16 characters of the hex-encoded hash
```

An example implementation in Python:

```python
def derive_keyset_id(keys: Dict[int, PublicKey]) -> str:
	"""Deterministic derivation keyset_id from set of public keys."""
	sorted_keys = dict(sorted(keys.items()))
	pubkeys_concat = "".join([p.serialize().hex() for _, p in sorted_keys.items()])
	return hashlib.sha256(pubkeys_concat.encode("utf-8")).hexdigest()[:16]
```

## Requesting public keys for a specific keyset
To receive the public keys of a specific (old) keyset, a wallet can call the `GET /keys/{keyset_id}` where `keyset_id` is the hex-encoded keyset ID. 

## Example

Request of `Alice`:

We request the keys for the keyset `9bb9d58392cd823e`.

```http
GET https://mint.host:3338/keys/9bb9d58392cd823e
```

With curl:

```bash
curl -X GET https://mint.host:3338/keys/9bb9d58392cd823e
```

Response of `Bob` (similar to [NUT-01][01]):

```json
{
  "keysets": [
    "id": "9bb9d58392cd823e",
    "symbol": "sat",
    "keys": {
        "1": "03a40f20667ed53513075dc51e715ff2046cad64eb68960632269ba7f0210e38bc",

        "8": "02fdfd6796bfeac490cbee12f778f867f0a2c68f6508d17c649759ea0dc3547528",
        ...
    }
  ]
}
