NUT-02: Keysets and keyset ID
==========================

`mandatory`

---

A keyset is a set of public keys that the mint `Bob` generates and shares with its users. It refers to the set of public keys that each correspond to the amount values that the mint supports (e.g. `1, 2, 4, 8, ...`) respectively.

Each keyset additionally indicates its keyset `id`, the currency `unit`, and whether the keyset is `active` or not. 

## Multiple keysets

#### Active keysets
Mints can have multiple keysets at the same time but **MUST** have at least one `active` keyset (see [NUT-01][01]). `Proofs` from inactive keysets are still accepted but new outputs (`BlindedMessages` and `BlindSignatures`) **MUST** be redeemed from `active` keysets only. 

#### Currency unit
Mints **MUST** generate a keysets for each `unit` they support.

#### Wallet input and output construction

Wallets **SHOULD** store keysets the first time they encounter them along with the URL of the mint they are from. That way, wallets can choose `Proofs` of all keysets of a mint from their database when selecting inputs for an operation. Wallets **SHOULD** spend `Proofs` of inactive keysets first. When constructing outputs for an operation, wallets **MUST** choose only `active` keysets (see [NUT-00][00]).

## Example

A wallet can ask the mint for a list of all keyset IDs via the `GET /v1/keysets` endpoint. 

Request of `Alice`:

```http
GET https://mint.host:3338/v1/keysets
```

With curl:

```bash
curl -X GET https://mint.host:3338/v1/keysets
```

Response `GetKeysetsResponse` of `Bob`:

```json
{
  "keysets": [
    {
      "id": <keyset_id_hex_str>,
      "unit": <currency_unit_str>,
      "active": <bool>
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
## Example response

```json
{
  "keysets": [
    {
      "id": "009a1f293253e41e",
      "unit": "sat",
      "active": True
    },
    {
      "id": "0042ade98b2a370a",
      "unit": "sat",
      "active": False
    },
    {
      "id": "00c074b96c7e2b0e",
      "unit": "usd",
      "active": True
    }    
  ]
}
```

#### Wallet implementation notes
Wallets can request the list of keyset IDs from the mint upon startup and load only tokens from its database that have a keyset ID supported by the mint it interacts with. This also helps wallets to determine whether the mint has rotated to a new current keyset (i.e. added new active keysets and inactivated old ones) and whether the wallet should recycle all tokens from inactive keysets to currently `active` ones.


## Keyset ID

A keyset `id` is an identifier for a specific keyset. It can be derived by anyone who knows the set of public keys of a mint. Wallets **CAN** compute the keyset `id` for a given keyset by themselves to confirm that the mint is supplying the correct keyset ID.

The keyset `id` is in each `Proof` so it can be used by wallets to identify which mint and keyset it was generated from. The keyset `id` is also stored in `BlindedMessages` sent to the mint and `BlindSignatures` returned from the mint (see [NUT-00][00]).

### Keyset ID version

Keyset IDs have a version byte (two hexadecimal characters). The currently used version byte is `00`. 

### Deriving the keyset ID

The mint and the wallets of its users can derive a keyset ID from the keyset of the mint. The keyset ID is a lower-case hex string. To derive the keyset ID of a keyset, execute the following steps:

```
1 - sort public keys by their amount in ascending order
2 - concatenate all public keys to one byte array
3 - HASH_SHA256 the concatenated public keys
4 - take the first 14 characters of the hex-encoded hash
5 - prefix it with a keyset ID version byte
```

An example implementation in Python:

```python
def derive_keyset_id(keys: Dict[int, PublicKey]) -> str:
    sorted_keys = dict(sorted(keys.items()))
    pubkeys_concat = b"".join([p.serialize() for p in sorted_keys.values()])
    return "00" + hashlib.sha256(pubkeys_concat).hexdigest()[:14]
```

## Requesting public keys for a specific keyset
To receive the public keys of a specific keyset, a wallet can call the `GET /v1/keys/{keyset_id}` endpoint where `keyset_id` is the keyset ID. 

## Example

Request of `Alice`:

We request the keys for the keyset `009a1f293253e41e`.

```http
GET https://mint.host:3338/v1/keys/009a1f293253e41e
```

With curl:

```bash
curl -X GET https://mint.host:3338/v1/keys/009a1f293253e41e
```

Response of `Bob` (same as [NUT-01][01]):

```json
