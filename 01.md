# NUT-01: Mint public key exchange

`mandatory`

---

This document outlines the exchange of the public keys of the mint `Bob` with the wallet user `Alice`. `Alice` uses the keys to unblind `Bob`'s blind signatures (see [NUT-00][00]).

## Description

Wallet user `Alice` receives public keys from mint `Bob` via `GET /v1/keys`. The set of all public keys for a set of amounts is called a _keyset_.

The mint responds only with its `active` keysets. Keyset are `active` if the mint will sign promises with it. The mint will accept tokens from inactive keysets as inputs but will not sign with them for new outputs. The `active` keysets can change over time, for example due to key rotation. A list of all keysets, active and inactive, can be requested separately (see [NUT-02][02]).

Note that a mint can support multiple keysets at the same time but will only respond with the active keysets on the endpoint `GET /v1/keys`. A wallet can ask for the keys of a specific (active or inactive) keyset via the endpoint `GET /v1/keys/{keyset_id}` (see [NUT-02][02]).

## Keyset generation

Keysets are generated by the mint. The mint is free to use any key generation method they like. Each keyset is identified by its keyset `id` which can be computed by anyone from its public keys (see [NUT-02][02]).

Keys in Keysets are maps of the form `{<amount_1> : <mint_pubkey_1>, <amount_2> : <mint_pubkey_2>, ...}` for each `<amount_i>` of the amounts the mint `Bob` supports and the corresponding public key `<mint_pubkey_1>`, that is `K_i` (see [NUT-00][00]). The mint **MUST** use the [compressed Secp256k1 public key format](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/public-key#public-key-format) to represent its public keys.

## Example

Request of `Alice`:

```http
GET https://mint.host:3338/v1/keys
```

With curl:

```bash
curl -X GET https://mint.host:3338/v1/keys
```

Response `GetKeysResponse` of `Bob`:

```json
{
  "keysets": [
    {
      "id": <keyset_id_hex_str>,
      "unit": <currency_unit_str>,
      "keys": {
        <amount_int>: <public_key_str>,
        ...
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Example response

```json

  "keysets": [
    {
