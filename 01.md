NUT-01: Mint public key exchange
==========================

`mandatory` `author: calle` 

---

This describes the basic exchange of the public mint keys that the wallet user `Alice` uses to unblind `Bob`'s signature.

## Description

Wallet user `Alice` receives public keys from mint `Bob` via `GET /keys` and stores them in a key-value store like a dictionary. The set of all public keys for each supported amount is called a *keyset*.

Mint `Bob` responds with his *active* [keyset][02]. The active keyset is the keyset a mint currently uses to sign promises with. The active keyset can change over time, for example due to key rotation. A mint MAY support older keysets indefinitely. Note that a mint can support multiple keysets at the same time but will only respond with the active keyset on the endpoint `GET /keys`. A wallet can ask for the keys of a specific (non-active) keyset by using the endpoint `GET /keys/{keyset_id}` (see #2 [TODO: Link #2]).

See [TODO: Link #2] for how a wallet deals with multiple keysets.

Keysets are received as a JSON of the form `{<amount_1> : <mint_pubkey_1>, <amount_2> : ...}` for each `<amount_i>` of the amounts the mint `Bob` supports and the corresponding public key `<mint_pubkey_1>`, that is `K_i` (see #0 [TODO: Link #0]). 

## Example

Request of `Alice`:

```http
GET https://mint.host:3338/keys
```

With curl:

```bash
curl -X GET https://mint.host:3338/keys
```

Response of `Bob`:

```json
