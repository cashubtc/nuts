# NUT-27 Test Vectors

## Key Derivation

We derive Nostr backup keys from the following BIP39 mnemonic.

```json
{
  "mnemonic": "half depart obvious quality work element tank gorilla view sugar picture humble"
}
```

The domain separator used for key derivation is `cashu-mint-backup`.

The derived secret key (hex) is

```json
{
  "secret_key": "e7ca79469a270b36617e4227ff2f068d3bcbb6b072c8584190b0203597c53c0d"
}
```

The corresponding public key (hex) is

```json
{
  "public_key": "0767277aaed200af7a8843491745272fc1ad2c7bfe340225e6f34f3a9a273aed"
}
```
