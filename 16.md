NUT-16: Animated QR codes
==========================

`optional`

---

This document outlines how tokens should be displayed as QR codes for sending them between two wallets. 

## Introduction

QR codes are a great way to send and receive Cashu tokens. Before a token can be shared as a QR code, it needs to be serialized (see [NUT-00][00]).

### Static QR codes

If the serialized token is not too large (i.e. includes less than or equal to 2 proofs) it can usually be shared as a static QR code. This might not be the case if the secret includes long scripts or the token has a long memo or mint URL.

### Animated QR codes

If a token is too large to be displayed as a single QR code, we use animated QR codes are based on the [UR](https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/ur/) protocol. The sender produces an animated QR code from a serialized Cashu token. The receiver scans the animated QR code until the UR decoder is able to decode the token.
