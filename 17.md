# NUT-17: WebSockets

`optional`, `depends on: NUT-07`

---

This NUT defines a websocket protocol that enables bidirectional communication between apps and mints using the JSON-RPC format.

## Subscriptions

The websocket enables real-time subscriptions that wallets can use to receive notifications for a state change of a `MintQuoteResponse` ([NUT-04][04]), `MeltQuoteResponse` ([NUT-05][05]), `CheckStateResponse` ([NUT-07][07]).

A summary of the subscription flow is the following:

1. A wallet connects to the websocket endpoint and sends a `WsRequest` with the `subscribe` command.
2. The mint responds with a `WsResponse` containing an ok or an error.
3. If the subscription was accepted, the mint sends a `WsNotification` of the current state of the subscribed objects and whenever there is an update for the wallet's subscriptions.
4. To close a subscription, the wallet sends `WsRequest` with the `unsubscribe` command.

## Specifications

The websocket is reachable via the mint's URL path `/v1/ws`:

```
https://mint.com/v1/ws
```

`NUT-17` uses the JSON-RPC format for all messages. There are three types of messages defined in this NUT.

### Requests

All requests from the wallet to the mint are of the form of a `WsRequest`:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": <str_enum[WsRequestMethod]>,
  "params": <str_WsRequestParams>,
  "id": <int>
}
```
`WsRequestMethod` is a enum of strings with the supported commands `"subscribe"` and `"unsubscribe"`:

```ts
enum WsRequestMethod {
  sub = "subscribe",
  unsub = "unsubscribe",
}
```

`WsRequestParams` is a serialized JSON with the parameters of the corresponding command.

#### Command: Subscribe

To subscribe to updates, the wallet sends a `"subscribe"` command with the following `params` parameters:

```json
{
  "kind": <str_enum[SubscriptionKind]>,
  "subId": <string>,
  "filters": <string[]>
}
```

Here, `subId` is a unique uuid generated by the wallet and allows the client to map its requests to the mint's responses.

`SubscriptionKind` is an enum with the following possible values:

```ts
enum SubscriptionKind {
  bolt11_melt_quote = "bolt11_melt_quote",
  bolt11_mint_quote = "bolt11_mint_quote",
  proof_state = "proof_state"
}
```

The `filters` are an array of mint quote IDs ([NUT-04][04]), or melt quote IDs ([NUT-05][05]), or `Y`'s ([NUT-07][07]) of the corresponding object to receive updates from. 

As an example, `filters` would be of the following form to subscribe for updates of three different mint quote IDs:
```json
[
  "20385fc7245...", "d06667cda9b...", "e14d8ca96f..."
]
```

Note that `id` and `subId` are unrelated. The `subId` is the ID for each subscription, whereas `id` is part of the JSON-RPC spec and is an integer counter that must be incremented for every request sent over the websocket.

**Important:** If the subscription is accepted by the mint, the mint MUST first respond with the *current* state of the subscribed object and continue sending any further updates to it. 

For example, if the wallet subscribes to a `Proof.Y` of a `Proof` that has not been spent yet, the mint will first respond with a `ProofState` with `state == "UNSPENT"`. If the wallet then spends this `Proof`, the mint would send a `ProofState` with `state == "PENDING"` and then one with `state == "SPENT"`. In total, the mint would send three notifications to the wallet.

#### Command: Unsubscribe

The wallet should always unsubscribe any subscriptions that is isn't interested in anymore. The parameters for the `"unsubscribe"` command is only the subscription ID:

```json
{
  "subId": <string>
}
```

### Responses

A `WsResponse` is returned by the mint to both the `"subscribe"` and `"unsubscribe"` commands and indicates whether the request was successful:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "status": "OK",
    "subId": <str>
  },
  "id": <int>
}
```

Here, the `id` corresponds to the `id` in the request (as part of the JSON-RPC spec) and `subId` corresponds to the subscription ID.

### Notifications

`WsNotification`'s are sent from the mint to the wallet and contain subscription data in the following format

```ts
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "subscribe",
  "params": {
    "subId": <str>,
    "payload": NotificationPayload
  }
}
```

`subId` is the subscription ID (previously generated by the wallet) this notification corresponds to. `NotificationPayload` carries the subscription data which is a `MintQuoteResponse` ([NUT-04][04]), a `MeltQuoteResponse` ([NUT-05][05]), or a `CheckStateResponse` ([NUT-07][07]), depending on what the corresponding `SubscriptionKind` was.

### Errors

`WsErrors` for a given `WsRequest` are returned in the following format

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "error": {
    "code": -32601,
    "message": "Human readable error message"
  },
  "id": "1"
}
```

### Example: `ProofState` subscription
To subscribe to the `ProofState` of a `Proof`, the wallet establishes a websocket connection to `https://mint.com/v1/ws` and sends a `WsRequest` with a `filters` chosen to be the a `Proof.Y` value of the `Proof` (see [NUT-00][00]). Note that `filters` is an array meaning multiple subscriptions of the same `kind` can be made in the same request.

Wallet:
```json
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 0, "method": "subscribe", "params": {"kind": "proof_state", "filters": ["02e208f9a78cd523444aadf854a4e91281d20f67a923d345239c37f14e137c7c3d"], "subId": "Ua_IYvRHoCoF_wsZFlJ1m4gBDB--O0_6_n0zHg2T"}}
```

The mint first responds with a `WsResponse` confirming that the subscription has been added.

Mint:
```json
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "result": {"status": "OK", "subId": "Ua_IYvRHoCoF_wsZFlJ1m4gBDB--O0_6_n0zHg2T"}, "id": 0}
```

The mint immediately sends the current `ProofState` of the subscription as a `WsNotification`.

Mint:
```json
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "subscribe", "params": {"subId": "Ua_IYvRHoCoF_wsZFlJ1m4gBDB--O0_6_n0zHg2T", "payload": {"Y": "02e208f9a78cd523444aadf854a4e91281d20f67a923d345239c37f14e137c7c3d", "state": "UNSPENT", "witness": null}}}
```
While leaving the websocket connection open, the wallet then spends the ecash. The mint sends `WsNotification` updating the wallet about state changes of the `ProofState` accordingly:

Mint:
```json
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "subscribe", "params": {"subId": "Ua_IYvRHoCoF_wsZFlJ1m4gBDB--O0_6_n0zHg2T", "payload": {"Y": "02e208f9a78cd523444aadf854a4e91281d20f67a923d345239c37f14e137c7c3d", "state": "PENDING"}}}

{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "subscribe", "params": {"subId": "Ua_IYvRHoCoF_wsZFlJ1m4gBDB--O0_6_n0zHg2T", "payload": {"Y": "02e208f9a78cd523444aadf854a4e91281d20f67a923d345239c37f14e137c7c3d", "state": "SPENT"}}}
```

The wallet then unsubscribes.

Wallet:
```json
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "unsubscribe", "params": {"subId": "Ua_IYvRHoCoF_wsZFlJ1m4gBDB--O0_6_n0zHg2T"}}
```

## Signaling Support via NUT-06

Mints signal websocket support via [NUT-06][06] using the following setting:

```json
"nuts": {
    "17": {
      "supported": [
        {
          "method": <str>,
          "unit": <str>,
          "commands": <str[]>
        },
        ...
      ]
    }
}
```

Here, `commands` is an array of the commands that the mint supports. A mint that supports all commands would return `["bolt11_mint_quote", "bolt11_melt_quote", "proof_state"]`. Supported commands are given for each method-unit pair.

Example:
```json
"nuts": {
    "17": {
      "supported": [
        {
          "method": "bolt11",
          "unit": "sat",
          "commands": [
            "bolt11_mint_quote", 
            "bolt11_melt_quote", 
            "proof_state"
            ]
        },
      ]
    }
}
```
