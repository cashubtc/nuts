# NUT-17: WebSockets

`optional`

`used in: NUT-07, NUT-23, NUT-25`

---

This NUT defines a websocket protocol that enables bidirectional communication between apps and mints using the JSON-RPC format. It provides the general framework for real-time subscriptions, with specifics for each supported subscription type provided in dedicated NUTs.

## Subscriptions

The websocket enables real-time subscriptions that wallets can use to receive notifications for a state change as defined in the corresponding NUT:

- [NUT-07][07] for proof state subscriptions
- [NUT-23][23] for bolt11 mint and melt quote subscriptions
- [NUT-25][23] for bolt12 mint and melt quote subscriptions

## General Flow

The websocket subscription process follows these steps for all subscription types:

1. A wallet connects to the websocket endpoint and sends a `WsRequest` with the `subscribe` command.
2. The mint responds with a `WsResponse` containing an ok or an error.
3. If the subscription was accepted, the mint sends a `WsNotification` of the current state of the subscribed objects and whenever there is an update for the wallet's subscriptions.
4. To close a subscription, the wallet sends `WsRequest` with the `unsubscribe` command.

## Specifications

The websocket is reachable via the mint's URL path `/v1/ws`:

```
https://mint.com/v1/ws
```

`NUT-17` uses the JSON-RPC format for all messages. There are three types of messages defined in this NUT.

### Requests

All requests from the wallet to the mint are of the form of a `WsRequest`:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": <str_enum[WsRequestMethod]>,
  "params": <str_WsRequestParams>,
  "id": <int>
}
```

`WsRequestMethod` is a enum of strings with the supported commands `"subscribe"` and `"unsubscribe"`:

```ts
enum WsRequestMethod {
  sub = "subscribe",
  unsub = "unsubscribe",
}
```

`WsRequestParams` is a serialized JSON with the parameters of the corresponding command.

#### Command: Subscribe

To subscribe to updates, the wallet sends a `"subscribe"` command with the following `params` parameters:

```json
{
  "kind": <str_enum[SubscriptionKind]>,
  "subId": <string>,
  "filters": <string[]>
}
```

Here, `subId` is a unique uuid generated by the wallet and allows the client to map its requests to the mint's responses.

`SubscriptionKind` specifies what type of subscription the wallet wants to create where specific kinds are defined in their corresponding NUT.

The `filters` are an array of identifiers for the specific objects to receive updates from. The format of these identifiers depends on the subscription kind.

As an example, `filters` would be of the following form to subscribe for updates of three different mint quote IDs:

```json
["20385fc7245...", "d06667cda9b...", "e14d8ca96f..."]
```

Note that `id` and `subId` are unrelated. The `subId` is the ID for each subscription, whereas `id` is part of the JSON-RPC spec and is an integer counter that must be incremented for every request sent over the websocket.

**Important:** If the subscription is accepted by the mint, the mint MUST first respond with the _current_ state of the subscribed object and continue sending any further updates to it.

For example, if the wallet subscribes to a `Proof.Y` of a `Proof` that has not been spent yet, the mint will first respond with a `ProofState` with `state == "UNSPENT"`. If the wallet then spends this `Proof`, the mint would send a `ProofState` with `state == "PENDING"` and then one with `state == "SPENT"`. In total, the mint would send three notifications to the wallet.

#### Command: Unsubscribe

The wallet should always unsubscribe any subscriptions that is isn't interested in anymore. The parameters for the `"unsubscribe"` command is only the subscription ID:

```json
{
  "subId": <string>
}
```

### Responses

A `WsResponse` is returned by the mint to both the `"subscribe"` and `"unsubscribe"` commands and indicates whether the request was successful:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "status": "OK",
    "subId": <str>
  },
  "id": <int>
}
```

Here, the `id` corresponds to the `id` in the request (as part of the JSON-RPC spec) and `subId` corresponds to the subscription ID.

### Notifications

`WsNotification`'s are sent from the mint to the wallet and contain subscription data in the following format

```ts
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "subscribe",
  "params": {
    "subId": <str>,
    "payload": NotificationPayload
  }
}
```

- `subId` is the subscription ID (previously generated by the wallet) this notification corresponds to
- `NotificationPayload` carries the subscription data defined by the `SubscriptionKind`.

### Errors

`WsErrors` for a given `WsRequest` are returned in the following format

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "error": {
    "code": -32601,
    "message": "Human readable error message"
  },
  "id": "1"
}
```

### Example: `ProofState` subscription

To subscribe to the `ProofState` of a `Proof`, the wallet establishes a websocket connection to `https://mint.com/v1/ws` and sends a `WsRequest` with a `filters` chosen to be the a `Proof.Y` value of the `Proof` (see [NUT-00][00]). Note that `filters` is an array meaning multiple subscriptions of the same `kind` can be made in the same request.

Wallet:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 0,
  "method": "subscribe",
  "params": {
    "kind": "proof_state",
    "filters": [
      "02e208f9a78cd523444aadf854a4e91281d20f67a923d345239c37f14e137c7c3d"
    ],
    "subId": "Ua_IYvRHoCoF_wsZFlJ1m4gBDB--O0_6_n0zHg2T"
  }
}
```

The mint first responds with a `WsResponse` confirming that the subscription has been added.

Mint:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "status": "OK",
    "subId": "Ua_IYvRHoCoF_wsZFlJ1m4gBDB--O0_6_n0zHg2T"
  },
  "id": 0
}
```

The mint immediately sends the current `ProofState` of the subscription as a `WsNotification`.

Mint:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "subscribe",
  "params": {
    "subId": "Ua_IYvRHoCoF_wsZFlJ1m4gBDB--O0_6_n0zHg2T",
    "payload": {
      "Y": "02e208f9a78cd523444aadf854a4e91281d20f67a923d345239c37f14e137c7c3d",
      "state": "UNSPENT",
      "witness": null
    }
  }
}
```

While leaving the websocket connection open, the wallet then spends the ecash. The mint sends `WsNotification` updating the wallet about state changes of the `ProofState` accordingly:

Mint:

```json
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "subscribe", "params": {"subId": "Ua_IYvRHoCoF_wsZFlJ1m4gBDB--O0_6_n0zHg2T", "payload": {"Y": "02e208f9a78cd523444aadf854a4e91281d20f67a923d345239c37f14e137c7c3d", "state": "PENDING"}}}

{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "subscribe", "params": {"subId": "Ua_IYvRHoCoF_wsZFlJ1m4gBDB--O0_6_n0zHg2T", "payload": {"Y": "02e208f9a78cd523444aadf854a4e91281d20f67a923d345239c37f14e137c7c3d", "state": "SPENT"}}}
```

The wallet then unsubscribes.

Wallet:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "unsubscribe",
  "params": { "subId": "Ua_IYvRHoCoF_wsZFlJ1m4gBDB--O0_6_n0zHg2T" }
}
```

## Mint info setting

Mints signal websocket support via [NUT-06][06] using the following setting:

```json
"nuts": {
    "17": {
      "supported": [
        {
          "method": <str>,
          "unit": <str>,
          "commands": <str[]>
        },
        ...
      ]
    }
}
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
Here, `commands` is an array of the commands that the mint supports. A mint that supports all commands would return `["bolt11_mint_quote", "bolt11_melt_quote", "bolt12_mint_quote", "bolt12_melt_quote", "proof_state"]`. Supported commands are given for each method-unit pair.
=======
Here, `commands` is an array of the commands that the mint supports. Supported commands are given for each method-unit pair.
>>>>>>> fb15af3 (abstract NUT-17 subscription kinds)

Example:

```json
"nuts": {
    "17": {
      "supported": [
        {
          "method": "bolt11",
          "unit": "sat",
          "commands": [
            "bolt11_mint_quote",
            "bolt11_melt_quote",
            "proof_state"
            ]
        },
      ]
    }
}
```

## Adding New Subscription Types

To add a new subscription type, implement the following in the corresponding NUT:

1. Define the subscription kind identifier (ie `bolt11_melt_quote`)
2. Specify the format of the `filters` array
3. Define the `NotificationPayload` structure
