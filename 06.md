# NUT-06: Mint information

`mandatory`

---

This endpoint returns information about the mint that a wallet can show to the user and use to make decisions on how to interact with the mint.

## Example

**Request** of `Alice`:

```http
GET https://mint.host:3338/v1/info
```

With the mint's response being of the form `GetInfoResponse`:

```json

- (optional) `name` is the name of the mint and should be recognizable.
- (optional) `pubkey` is the hex pubkey of the mint.
- (optional) `version` is the implementation name and the version of the software running on this mint separated with a slash "/".
- (optional) `description` is a short description of the mint that can be shown in the wallet next to the mint's name.
- (optional) `description_long` is a long description that can be shown in an additional field.
- (optional) `contact` is an array of contact objects to reach the mint operator. A contact object consists of two fields. The `method` field denotes the contact method (like "email"), the `info` field denotes the identifier (like "contact@me.com").
- (optional) `motd` is the message of the day that the wallet must display to the user. It should only be used to display important announcements to users, such as scheduled maintenances.
- (optional) `icon_url` is the URL pointing to an image to be used as an icon for the mint. Recommended to be squared in shape.
- (optional) `urls` is the list of endpoint URLs where the mint is reachable at. All these URLs must be stripped of any trailing slashes (`/`).
- (optional) `time` is the current time set on the server. The value is passed as a Unix timestamp integer.
- (optional) `nuts` indicates each NUT specification that the mint supports and its settings. The settings are defined in each NUT separately.

With curl:

```bash
curl -X GET https://mint.host:3338/v1/info
```

### Mint Implementation Notes

- Adding URLs has no impact on existing tokens, however changing or removing URLs may render some wallets unable to redeem previously issued tokens with defunct URLs. The mint should therefore exercise caution when changing or removing URLs. The mint may use the `motd` field to announce such changes in advance.

### Wallet Implementation Notes

- Wallets should periodically query the Mint Info and store the retrieved mint URLs. If the `motd` has changed compared to the last time it was fetched, the wallet must display it to the user.
- Receiving: if the mint is not known, the wallet should query and store the Mint Info, to ensure the wallet is aware of all the mint's URLs. If it's not possible to do it upon receiving (Offline Receive), the wallet should do it the next time it comes online.
- Sending: when creating a token for sending, the wallet embeds a single mint URL. For mints with multiple known URLs, the wallet must choose an active mint URL. For this, the client must test the URL first, for example by fetching the Mint's Info at that endpoint.
