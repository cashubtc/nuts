NUT-06: Mint information
==========================

`mandatory`

---

This endpoint returns information about the mint that a wallet can show to the user and use to make decisions on how to interact with the mint.

## Example

**Request** of `Alice`:

```http
GET https://mint.host:3338/v1/info
```

With the mint's response being of the form `GetInfoResponse`:

```json
{
  "name": "Bob's Cashu mint",
  "pubkey": "0283bf290884eed3a7ca2663fc0260de2e2064d6b355ea13f98dec004b7a7ead99",
  "version": "Nutshell/0.15.0",
  "description": "The short mint description",
  "description_long": "A description that can be a long piece of text.",
  "contact": [
    ["email", "contact@me.com"],
    ["twitter", "@me"],
    ["nostr" ,"npub..."]
  ],  
  "motd": "Message to display to users.",  
  "nuts": {
    "4": {
      "methods": [
        ["bolt11", "sat"]
      ],
      "disabled": false
    },
    "5": {
      "methods": [
        ["bolt11", "sat"]
      ]
    },
    "7": {"supported": true},
    "8": {"supported": true},
    "9": {"supported": true},
    "10": {"supported": true},
    "12": {"supported": true}
  }
}
```

- `name` is the name of the mint and should be recognizable. 
- `pubkey` is the hex pubkey of the mint.
- `version` is the implementation name and the version of the software running on this mint separated with a slash "/", 
- `description` is a short description of the mint that can be shown in the wallet next to the mint's name. 
- `description_long` is a long description that can be shown in an additional field.
- `contact` is an array of contact methods to reach the mint operator. A contact method consists of two fields. The first denotes the method (like "email"), the second the identifier (like "contact@me.com").
- `modt` is the message of the day that the wallet must display to the user. It should only be used to display important announcements to users, such as scheduled maintenances. 
- `nuts` indicates each NUT specification that the mint supports and its settings. The settings are defined in each NUT separately.
