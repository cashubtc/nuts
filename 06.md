This endpoint returns information about the mint that a wallet can show to the user and use to make decisions on how to interact with the mint.

```

With the mint's response being of the form `GetInfoResponse`:

```json

- `name` is the name of the mint and should be recognizable. 
- `pubkey` is the hex pubkey of the mint.
- `version` is the implementation name and the version of the software running on this mint separated with a slash "/", 
- `description` is a short description of the mint that can be shown in the wallet next to the mint's name. 
- `description_long` is a long description that can be shown in an additional field.
- `contact` is an array of contact methods to reach the mint operator. A contact method consists of two fields. The first denotes the method (like "email"), the second the identifier (like "contact@me.com").
- `modt` is the message of the day that the wallet must display to the user. It should only be used to display important announcements to users, such as scheduled maintenances. 
- `nuts` indicates each NUT specification that the mint supports and its settings. The settings are defined in each NUT separately.
