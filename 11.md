# NUT-11: Pay to Public Key (P2PK)

`optional`

`depends on: NUT-10, NUT-08`

---

This NUT describes Pay-to-Public-Key (P2PK) which is one kind of spending condition based on [NUT-10][10]'s well-known `Secret`. Using P2PK, we can lock ecash tokens to a receiver's ECC public key and require a Schnorr signature with the corresponding private key to unlock the ecash. The spending condition is enforced by the mint.

Caution: If the mint does not support this type of spending condition, proofs may be treated as a regular anyone-can-spend tokens. Applications need to make sure to check whether the mint supports a specific kind of spending condition by checking the mint's [NUT-06][06] info endpoint.

## Pay-to-Pubkey

[NUT-10][10] Secret `kind: P2PK`

If for a `Proof`, `Proof.secret` is a `Secret` of kind `P2PK`, the proof must be unlocked by providing a witness `Proof.witness` and one or more valid signatures in the array `Proof.witness.signatures`.

In the basic case, when spending a locked token, the mint requires one valid Schnorr signature in `Proof.witness.signatures` on `Proof.secret` by the public key in `Proof.Secret.data`.

To give a concrete example of the basic case, to mint a locked token we first create a P2PK `Secret` that reads:

```json
[
  "P2PK",
  {
    "nonce": "859d4935c4907062a6297cf4e663e2835d90d97ecdd510745d32f6816323a41f",
    "data": "0249098aa8b9d2fbec49ff8598feb17b592b986e62319a4fa488a3dc36387157a7",
    "tags": [["sigflag", "SIG_INPUTS"]]
  }
]
```

Here, `Secret.data` is the public key of the recipient of the locked ecash. We serialize this `Secret` to a string in `Proof.secret` and get a blind signature by the mint that is stored in `Proof.C` (see [NUT-03][03]]).

The recipient who owns the private key of the public key `Secret.data` can spend this proof by providing a signature on the serialized `Proof.secret` string that is then added to `Proof.witness.signatures`:

```json
{
  "amount": 1,
  "secret": "[\"P2PK\",{\"nonce\":\"859d4935c4907062a6297cf4e663e2835d90d97ecdd510745d32f6816323a41f\",\"data\":\"0249098aa8b9d2fbec49ff8598feb17b592b986e62319a4fa488a3dc36387157a7\",\"tags\":[[\"sigflag\",\"SIG_INPUTS\"]]}]",
  "C": "02698c4e2b5f9534cd0687d87513c759790cf829aa5739184a3e3735471fbda904",
  "id": "009a1f293253e41e",
  "witness": "{\"signatures\":[\"60f3c9b766770b46caac1d27e1ae6b77c8866ebaeba0b9489fe6a15a837eaa6fcd6eaa825499c72ac342983983fd3ba3a8a41f56677cc99ffd73da68b59e1383\"]}"
}
```

### Signature scheme

To spend a token locked with `P2PK`, the spender needs to include signatures in the spent proofs. We use `libsecp256k1`'s serialized 64 byte Schnorr signatures on the SHA256 hash of the message to sign. The message to sign is the field `Proof.secret` in the inputs. If indicated by `Secret.tags.sigflag` in the inputs, outputs might also require signatures on the message `BlindedMessage.B_`.

An ecash spending operation like [swap][03] and [melt][05] can have multiple inputs and outputs. If we have more than one input or output, we provide signatures in each `Proof` and `BlindedMessage` individually. The inputs are the `Proofs` provided in the `inputs` field and the outputs are the `BlindedMessages` in the `outputs` field in the request body (see `PostMeltRequest` in [NUT-05][05] and `PostSwapRequest` in [NUT-03][03]).

### Tags

More complex spending conditions can be defined in the tags in `Proof.tags`. All tags are optional. Tags are arrays with two or more strings being `["key", "value1", "value2", ...]`.

Supported tags are:

- `sigflag: <str>` determines whether outputs have to be signed as well
- `n_sigs: <int>` specifies the minimum number of valid signatures expected
- `pubkeys: <hex_str>` are additional public keys (together with the one in the `data` field of the secret) that can provide signatures (_allows multiple entries_)
- `locktime: <int>` is the Unix timestamp of when the lock expires
- `refund: <hex_str>` are optional refund public keys that can exclusively spend after `locktime` (_allows multiple entries_)

**Note:** The tag serialization type is `[<str>, <str>, ...]` but some tag values are `int`. Wallets and mints must cast types appropriately for de/serialization.

#### Signature flags

Signature flags are defined in the tag `Secret.tags['sigflag']`. Currently, there are two signature flags.

- `SIG_INPUTS` requires valid signatures on all inputs independently. It is the default signature flag and will be applied even if the `sigflag` tag is absent.
- `SIG_ALL` requires valid signatures on all inputs and on all outputs of a transaction.

If any one input has the signature flag `SIG_ALL`, then all inputs are required to have the flag `SIG_ALL` and the same `Secret.data` and `Secret.tags` (see [here](#sig_inputs)), otherwise an error is returned.

`SIG_INPUTS` is only enforced if no input is `SIG_ALL`.

#### Signature flag `SIG_INPUTS`

`SIG_INPUTS` means that each `Proof` (input) requires it's own signature. The signature is provided in the `Proof.witness` field of each input separately. The format of the [witness](#witness-format) is defined later on.

##### Signed inputs

A `Proof` (an input) with a signature `P2PKWitness.signatures` on `secret` is the JSON (see [NUT-00][00]):

```json
{
  "amount": <int>,
  "secret": <str>,
  "C": <hex_str>,
  "id": <str>,
  "witness": <P2PKWitness | str> // Signatures on "secret"
}
```

The `secret` field is **signed as a string**.

#### Signature flag `SIG_ALL`

`SIG_ALL` is enforced only if the following conditions are met:

- If one input has the signature flag `SIG_ALL`, all other inputs MUST have the same `Secret.data` and `Secret.tags`, and by extension, also be `SIG_ALL`.
- If one or more inputs differ from this, an error is returned.

If this condition is met, the `SIG_ALL` flag is enforced and only **the first input of a transaction requires a witness** that covers all other inputs and outputs of the transaction. All signatures by the signing public keys MUST be provided in the `Proof.witness` of the first input of the transaction.

##### Message aggregation

The message to be signed depends on the type of transaction containing an input with signature flag `SIG_ALL`.

##### Aggregation for `swap`

A swap contains `inputs` and `outputs` (see [NUT-03][03]). To provide a valid signature, the owner (or owners) of the signing public keys must concatenate the `secret` fields of all `Proofs` (inputs), and the `B_` fields of all `BlindedMessages` (outputs, see [NUT-00][00]) to a single message string in the order they appear in the transaction. This string concatenated is then hashed and signed (see [Signature scheme](#signature-scheme)).

If a swap transaction has `n` inputs and `m` outputs, the message to sign becomes:

```
msg = secret_0 || ... || secret_n || B_0 || ... || B_m
```

Here, `||` denotes string concatenation. The `B_` of each output is **a hex string**.

##### Aggregation for `melt`

For a melt transaction, the message to sign is composed of all the inputs, the quote ID being paid, and the [NUT-08][08] blank `outputs`.

If a melt transaction has `n` inputs, a quote ID `quote_id`, and `m` blank outputs, the message to sign becomes:

```
msg = secret_0 || ... || secret_n || quote_id || B_0 || ... || B_m
```

Here, `||` denotes string concatenation. The `B_` of each output is **a hex string**.

#### Witness format

Signatures are stored in `P2PKWitness` objects and are provided in either each `Proof.witness` of all inputs separately (for `SIG_INPUTS`) or only in the first input of the transaction (for `SIG_ALL`). `P2PKWitness` is a serialized JSON string of the form

```json
{
  "signatures": <Array[<hex_str>]>
}
```

The `signatures` are an array of signatures in hex and correspond to the signatures by one or multiple signing public keys.

### Multisig

If the tag `n_sigs` is a positive integer, the mint will require `n_sigs` signatures from public keys specified in the `pubkeys` tag additional to the public key in `Secret.data`. If the number of valid signatures is greater or equal to the number specified in `n_sigs`, the transaction is valid. The individual signatures are provided in an array of strings in the `P2PKWitness` object.

Expressed as an "n-of-m" scheme, `n = n_sigs` is the number of required signatures and `m = 1 ("data" field) + len(pubkeys tag)` is the number of public keys that could sign.

### Locktime

If the tag `locktime` is the unix time and the mint's local clock is greater than `locktime`, the `Proof` becomes spendable by anyone, except if the following condition is also true. Note: A `Proof` is considered spendable by anyone if it only requires a `secret` and a valid signature `C` to be spent (which is the default case).

#### Refund public keys

If the `locktime` is in the past and a tag `refund` is present, the `Proof` is spendable only if a valid signature by one of the the `refund` pubkeys is provided in `Proof.witness.signatures` and, depending on the signature flag, in `BlindedMessage.witness.signatures`.

#### Complex Example

This is an example `Secret` that locks a `Proof` with a Pay-to-Pubkey (P2PK) condition that requires 2-of-3 signatures from the public keys in the `data` field and the `pubkeys` tag. If the `timelock` has passed, the `Proof` becomes spendable with a single signature from the public key in the `refund` tag. The signature flag `sigflag` indicates that signatures are necessary on the `inputs` and the `outputs` of the transaction this `Proof` is spent by.

```json
[
  "P2PK",
  {
    "nonce": "da62796403af76c80cd6ce9153ed3746",
    "data": "033281c37677ea273eb7183b783067f5244933ef78d8c3f15b1a77cb246099c26e",
    "tags": [
      ["sigflag", "SIG_ALL"],
      ["n_sigs", "2"],
      ["locktime", "1689418329"],
      [
        "refund",
        "033281c37677ea273eb7183b783067f5244933ef78d8c3f15b1a77cb246099c26e"
      ],
      [
        "pubkeys",
        "02698c4e2b5f9534cd0687d87513c759790cf829aa5739184a3e3735471fbda904",
        "023192200a0cfd3867e48eb63b03ff599c7e46c8f4e41146b2d281173ca6c50c54"
      ]
    ]
  }
]
```

## Use cases

The following use cases are unlocked using P2PK:

- Publicly post locked ecash that can only be redeemed by the intended receiver
- Final offline-receiver payments that can't be double-spent when combined with an offline signature check mechanism like DLEQ proofs
- Receiver of locked ecash can defer and batch multiple mint round trips for receiving proofs (requires DLEQ)
- Ecash that is owned by multiple people via the multisignature abilities
- Atomic swaps when used in combination with the locktime feature

## Mint info setting
