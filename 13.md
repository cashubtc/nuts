NUT-13: QR-codes
==========================

NUT-13 outlines how tokens should be encoded and displayed as QR

## Introduction

QR codes are a great way to share data in an air-gapped way. Meaning, devices can share data, without being connected to a network, using QR codes. One problem QR codes have, is their limited data size. They can only hold a limited amount of data, often not enough for ecash transactions that can consist of multiple `proofs`. To mitigate this limitation, animated QR codes  increase the amount of data that can be transfered.

## Protocol

### Static QR codes

Static QR codes are preferable. They can be interpreted by native QR code readers, such as the mobile phone camera app. Therefore, if the amount of data to be transfered allows it, a cashu token can be directly encoded into a QR code as such:

> cashuA.......

or

> cashu://cashuA.......

Usually, if the encoded token includes more than 1 proof, or includes additional script data in the secret, the token may be too large to be encoded in a single QR code. In which case, animated QR codes should be used.
