# NUT-26: OHTTP Transport for Mint APIs

`optional`

`depends on: NUT-06`

---

This NUT specifies how a Cashu mint can offer its HTTP API over Oblivious HTTP (OHTTP) to improve network‑level privacy for wallets. OHTTP lets a client send encrypted requests to an oblivious gateway (optionally via a relay). The gateway decrypts, forwards the plaintext HTTP request to the mint, and encrypts the response, preventing the mint from learning the client's network address and preventing the relay from seeing request contents.

This NUT does not change any existing Cashu API semantics. It only defines discovery and endpoints needed to use OHTTP with a mint.

## Terminology

- OHTTP: Oblivious HTTP as specified by the IETF OHAI working group.
- Gateway: The component that holds the OHTTP key config, decapsulates requests, forwards them to the mint backend, and encapsulates responses.
- Relay: A forwarder that sees only encrypted OHTTP messages and forwards them to the gateway.

For optimal privacy, the relay and mint SHOULD be operated by different entities that do not collude. The privacy guarantees of OHTTP depend on the relay and mint not working together to correlate user traffic patterns.

## Discovery via NUT‑06

Mints advertise OHTTP support in the `nuts` section of the [NUT‑06][06] `GetInfoResponse`.

```json
"nuts": {
  ...,
  "26": {
    "enabled": true,
    "gateway_url": "https://ohttp.example.com" // optional
  }
}
```

Fields:

- `enabled` (bool): Set to `true` when the mint supports OHTTP.
- `gateway_url` (str|null, optional): Base URL of the OHTTP gateway to use for key discovery (and, by convention, for the OHTTP gateway endpoint). If omitted or `null`, clients SHOULD assume the gateway is available on the mint's own origin.

Wallets SHOULD treat `gateway_url` as a hint for where to fetch OHTTP keys. A mint MAY operate the gateway on the same origin as the mint API, in which case `gateway_url` can be omitted.

## Gateway Endpoints

A gateway MUST expose the following endpoint:

- `GET /.well-known/ohttp-gateway` → returns the OHTTP key configuration
- `POST /.well-known/ohttp-gateway` → accepts encapsulated OHTTP requests
  - Request content type: `message/ohttp-req`
  - Response content type: `message/ohttp-res`
  - Body: opaque binary as defined by OHTTP

The GET method returns the OHTTP key configuration with content type `application/ohttp-keys` as specified in RFC 9540.

A deployment MAY route additional paths to the same handler (e.g., a catch‑all that accepts `message/ohttp-req`); clients MUST NOT rely on nonstandard paths.

## Client Behavior

- Key fetch: Wallets fetch the OHTTP key configuration from `gateway_url + "/.well-known/ohttp-gateway"` using a GET request. If `gateway_url` is not provided, wallets SHOULD fetch from the mint origin at `"/.well-known/ohttp-gateway"`.
- Encapsulation: Wallets construct a BHTTP request ([RFC 9292](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9292)) that mirrors a normal Cashu API call (method, scheme, authority, path, headers, and body), encapsulate it with the fetched key config, and send it to the OHTTP gateway endpoint at `"/.well-known/ohttp-gateway"` through a relay.
- Headers: Wallets include the same application‑level headers they would send directly to the mint (e.g., auth headers if applicable). The gateway forwards headers to the mint backend.
- Paths: The BHTTP request path is the regular Cashu API path (e.g., `/v1/mint/quote/bolt11`, `/v1/melt/bolt11`, `/v1/swap`, etc.). The gateway forwards the request to the mint backend preserving method, path, headers, and body.

Wallets MUST send OHTTP messages through a relay to the gateway.

## Errors

### Transport-Level Errors

Relays SHOULD forward HTTP responses from the gateway transparently, including error status codes. Gateways SHOULD respond with appropriate HTTP status codes for transport‑level errors (e.g., malformed OHTTP requests, key configuration issues).

### Application-Level Errors

Since request/response bodies are OHTTP‑encapsulated, application‑level Cashu errors from the mint backend remain unchanged and are handled by the wallet after decapsulation. The relay and gateway transparently forward these errors without modification.

## Security Considerations

- OHTTP provides network‑level unlinkability between client and mint. It does not hide application data from the gateway operator; the gateway must be trusted to forward requests without inspection or logging unless operated by the mint itself and configured for stateless processing.
- **Non-Collusion Requirement**: OHTTP's privacy guarantees rely on the relay and mint not colluding (working together to deanonymize users). For this reason, the relay and mint SHOULD be operated by different entities that do not share information about user traffic. When the same entity operates both the relay and mint, or when operators collude, they can correlate encrypted traffic patterns with mint operations, completely undermining the privacy benefits of OHTTP.
- Mints MUST publish valid OHTTP key configurations and rotate them as needed per the OHTTP specification.
- Wallets SHOULD validate URLs derived from mint info to avoid SSRF or downgrade attacks. If both direct HTTP and OHTTP are available, wallets SHOULD prefer OHTTP when a relay/gateway is configured and keys can be fetched successfully.
