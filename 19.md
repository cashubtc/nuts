# NUT-19: Signature on Mint Quote

`optional`

This NUT defines a protocol extension that enables signature-based authentication for mint quote redemption. When requesting a mint quote, clients can provide a public key. The mint will then require a valid signature from the corresponding secret key before processing the mint.
Caution: If the mint does not support this NUT, anyone with the mint quote id will be able to mint even without providing a signature.

# Mint quote

To request a mint quote, the wallet of `Alice` makes a `POST /v1/mint/quote/{method}` request where `method` is the payment method requested (here `bolt11`).

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/mint/quote/bolt11
```

The wallet of `Alice` includes the following `PostMintQuoteBolt11Request` data in its request:

```json
{
  "amount": <int>,
  "unit": <str_enum["sat"]>,
  "description": <str|null>,
  "pubkey": <str|null> <-- New
}
```

with the requested `amount` and the `unit`. An optional `description` can be passed if the mint signals support for it in `MintMethodSetting`. `pubkey` is the public key that will be required for signature verification during the minting process. The mint will only mint ecash after receiving a valid signature from the corresponding private key in the `PostMintRequest`.

> **Privacy:** To prevent linking multiple mint quotes together, wallets **SHOULD** generate a unique public key for each mint quote request

The mint `Bob` then responds with a `PostMintQuoteBolt11Response`:

```json
{
  "quote": <str>,
  "request": <str>,
  "state": <str_enum[STATE]>,
  "expiry": <int>,
  "pubkey": <str|null> <-- New
}
```

Where `quote` is the quote ID and `request` is the payment request to fulfill. `expiry` is the Unix timestamp until which the mint quote is valid.
`state` is an enum string field with possible values `"UNPAID"`, `"PAID"`, `"ISSUED"`:

- `"UNPAID"` means that the quote's request has not been paid yet.
- `"PAID"` means that the request has been paid.
- `"ISSUED"` means that the quote has already been issued.

## Example

Request of `Alice` with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3338/v1/mint/quote/bolt11 -d '{"amount": 10, "unit": "sat", "pubkey": "03d56ce4e446a85bbdaa547b4ec2b073d40ff802831352b8272b7dd7a4de5a7cac"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Response of `Bob`:

```json
{
  "quote": "9d745270-1405-46de-b5c5-e2762b4f5e00",
  "request": "lnbc100n1pj4apw9...",
  "state": "UNPAID",
  "expiry": 1701704757,
  "pubkey": "03d56ce4e446a85bbdaa547b4ec2b073d40ff802831352b8272b7dd7a4de5a7cac"
}
```

#### Message aggregation

To provide a signature for a mint request, the owner of one of the signing public keys must concatenate the `PostMintQuoteBolt11Response.quote` and the `B_` fields of all `BlindedMessages` (outputs, see [NUT-00][00]) to a single message string in the order they appear in the `PostMintRequest`. This string concatenated is then hashed and signed (see [Signature scheme](#signature-scheme)).

If a request has `n` outputs the message to sign becomes:

```
msg =  quote_id || B_0 || ... || B_n
```

Where || denotes concatenation, `quote_id` is a UTF-8 string, and each `B_` is a hex string, with all components encoded to UTF-8 bytes

#### Signature scheme

To mint a quote where a public key was provided, the minter needs to include signatures in the `PostMintBolt11Request`. We use a [BIP340](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340.mediawiki) signature on the SHA-256 hash of the message to sign as defined above.

# Minting tokens

After requesting a mint quote and paying the request, the wallet proceeds with minting new tokens by calling the `POST /v1/mint/{method}` endpoint where `method` is the payment method requested (here `bolt11`).

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/mint/bolt11
```

The wallet `Alice` includes the following `PostMintBolt11Request` data in its request

```json
{
  "quote": <str>,
  "outputs": <Array[BlindedMessage]>,
  "witness": <str|null> <-- New
}
```

with the `quote` being the quote ID from the previous step and `outputs` being `BlindedMessages` (see [NUT-00][00]) that the wallet requests signatures on whose sum is `amount` as requested in the quote. `witness` is the signature on the mint quote id as defined above.
The mint `Bob` then responds with a `PostMintBolt11Response`:

```json
{
  "signatures": <Array[BlindSignature]>
}
```

where `signatures` is an array of blind signatures on the outputs.

## Example

Request of `Alice` with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/mint/bolt11 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
'{
  "quote": "9d745270-1405-46de-b5c5-e2762b4f5e00",
  "outputs": [
    {
      "amount": 8,
      "id": "009a1f293253e41e",
      "B_": "035015e6d7ade60ba8426cefaf1832bbd27257636e44a76b922d78e79b47cb689d"
    },
    {
      "amount": 2,
      "id": "009a1f293253e41e",
      "B_": "0288d7649652d0a83fc9c966c969fb217f15904431e61a44b14999fabc1b5d9ac6"
    }
  ],
  "witness": "d9be080b33179387e504bb6991ea41ae0dd715e28b01ce9f63d57198a095bccc776874914288e6989e97ac9d255ac667c205fa8d90a211184b417b4ffdd24092"

}'
```

Response of `Bob`:

```json
{
  "signatures": [
    {
      "id": "009a1f293253e41e",
      "amount": 2,
      "C_": "0224f1c4c564230ad3d96c5033efdc425582397a5a7691d600202732edc6d4b1ec"
    },
    {
      "id": "009a1f293253e41e",
      "amount": 8,
      "C_": "0277d1de806ed177007e5b94a8139343b6382e472c752a74e99949d511f7194f6c"
    }
  ]
}
```

If the invoice was not paid yet, `Bob` responds with an error. In that case, `Alice` **MAY** repeat the same request until the Lightning invoice is settled, as in NUT04. If `Alice` does not include a witness on the `PostMintBolt11Request` but did include a `pubkey` in the `PostMintBolt11QuoteRequest` then `Bob` **MUST** respond with an error, `Alice` **SHOULD** repeat the request with a witness in order to mint the ecash.

## Settings

The settings for this NUT indicate the support for requiring a signature before minting. They are part of the info response of the mint ([NUT-06][06]) which in this case reads

```json
{
  "19": {
    "supported": <bool>,
    "required": <bool>
  }
}
```

In addition to signaling optional support, the mint can require a public key for mint quotes and a corresponding witness during minting. If `required` is set to `true` in the NUT-19 settings:

1. The wallet **MUST** provide a public key when requesting a mint quote
2. The wallet **MUST** provide a valid witness signature when submitting the mint request

> **Note:** Enabling this setting makes the mint incompatible with wallets that do not support NUT-19
