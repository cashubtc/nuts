NUT-19: Melt tokens Bitcoin On-Chain
==========================

`optional`

---

This NUT describes the process of melting tokens on Bitcoin On-Chain analog to NUT-05 for Bitcoin Lightning.

# Melt quote

To request a melt quote, the wallet of `Alice` makes a `POST /v1/melt/quote/{method}` request where `method` is the payment method requested (here `btconchain`). 

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/melt/quote/btconchain
```

The wallet `Alice` includes the following `PostMeltQuoteBtcOnchainRequest` data in its request:

```json
{
  "amount": <int>,
  "address": <str>,
  "unit": <str_enum["sat"]>
}
```

Here, `address` is the Bitcoin on chain address to be paid and `unit` is the unit the wallet would like to pay with.

The mint `Bob` then responds with an array of `PostMeltQuoteBtcOnchainResponse`:


```json
[
  {
   "quote": <str>,
   "description": <str|null>,
   "amount": <int>,
   "fee": <int>,
   "state": <str_enum[STATE]>,
   "expiry": <int>
  }
]
```
The mint can return multiple `PostMeltQuoteBtcOnchainResponse` with different `fees` and `expiry` dates. The wallet can choose which one to pay and the other ones will expire.  Where `quote` is the quote ID, `amount` the amount that needs to be provided, and `fee` the additional fee that is required. The mint expects `Alice` to include `Proofs` of *at least* `total_amount = amount + fee`. `paid` indicates whether the request as been paid and `expiry` is the Unix timestamp until which the melt quote is valid.

## Example

Request of `Alice` with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/melt/quote/btconchain -d \
{
  "address": "bc1qkyfgd7mus7ykfd7qkwakq75qsf7rtm...",
  "unit": "sat"
}
```

Response of `Bob`:

```json
[
  {
  "quote": "TRmjduhIsPxd...",
  "description": "1 sat per vbyte",
  "amount": 10,
  "fee": 2,
  "state": "UNPAID",
  "expiry": 1701704757  
  },
  {
    "quote": "OewtRaqe...",
    "description": "5 sat per vbyte",
    "amount": 10,
    "fee": 10,
    "state": "UNPAID",
    "expiry": 1701704757
  }
]
```

## Check melt quote state

To check whether a melt quote has been paid, `Alice` makes a `GET /v1/melt/quote/btconchain/{quote_id}`.

```http
GET https://mint.host:3338/v1/melt/quote/btconchain/{quote_id}
```

Like before, the mint `Bob` responds with a `PostMeltQuoteBtcOnchainResponse`.

Example request of `Alice` with curl:

```bash
curl -X GET https://mint.host:3338/v1/melt/quote/btconchain/TRmjduhIsPxd...
```

# Melting tokens

Now that `Alice` knows what the total amount is (`amount + fee`) in her requested `unit`, she can proceed for melting tokens for which a payment will be executed by the mint. She calls the `POST /v1/melt/{method}` endpoint where `method` is the payment method requested (here `btconchain`).

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/melt/btconchain
```

The wallet of `Alice` includes the following `PostMeltBtcOnchainRequest` data in its request

```json
{
  "quote": <str>,
  "inputs": <Array[Proof]>
}
```

Here, `quote` is the melt quote ID to be paid and `inputs` are the proofs with a total amount of at least `amount + fee` (see previous melt quote response).

The mint `Bob` then responds with a `PostMeltBtcOnchainResponse`:

```json
{
  "state": <str_enum[STATE]>,
  "txid": <str|null>
}

`txid` is the Bitcoin on chain transaction id of the transmitted transaction. 

`state` is an enum string field with possible values `"UNPAID"`, `"PENDING"`, `"PAID"`:
- `"UNPAID"` means that the request has not been paid yet.
- `"PENDING"` means that the request is currently being paid.
- `"PAID"` means that the request has been paid successfully.

If `state==PAID`, `Alice`'s wallet can delete the `inputs` from her database (or move them to a history). If `paid==PENDING`, `Alice` can repeat the same request again until the payment is successful.

## Example

Request of `Alice` with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/melt/btconchain -d \
'{
  "quote": "od4CN5smMMS3K3QVHkbGGNCTxfcAIyIXeq8IrfhP",
  "inputs": [
    {
      "amount": 4,
      "id": "009a1f293253e41e",
      "secret": "429700b812a58436be2629af8731a31a37fce54dbf8cbbe90b3f8553179d23f5",
      "C": "03b01869f528337e161a6768b480fcf9f75fd248b649c382f5e352489fd84fd011",
    },
    {
      "amount": 8,
      "id": "009a1f293253e41e",
      "secret": "4f3155acef6481108fcf354f6d06e504ce8b441e617d30c88924991298cdbcad",
      "C": "0278ab1c1af35487a5ea903b693e96447b2034d0fd6bac529e753097743bf73ca9",
    }
  ]
}'
```

Response of `Bob`: 

```json
{
  "state": "PENDING",
  "txid": "61470d1816e107165e08eb12a8526e7f6da9f6432fbb9da9f50fd0feb290a584"
}
```


# Check transaction status:
To check whether a Bitcoin onchain transaction has been paid, `Alice` makes a `GET /v1/melt/btconchain/{tx_id}`.

```http
GET https://mint.host:3338/v1/melt/btconchain/{tx_id}
```

The mint `Bob` responds with a `GetMeltBtcOnchainResponse`.

```json
{
  "state": "UNPAID"
}
```

# Settings
The settings for this nut indicate the supported method-unit pairs for melting. They are part of the info response of the mint ([NUT-06][06]) which in this case reads 
```json
{
  "19": {
    "supported": true,
    "methods": [
      {
        "method": "btconchain",
        "unit": "sat",
        "min_amount": 1000,
        "max_amount": 1000000
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
