# NUT-19: Cached Responses

`optional`

---

To mitigate the risk of potential ecash loss due to network errors during critical operations such as minting, swapping, and melting, we introduce a caching mechanism for successful responses. This mechanism uses the `POST` request path and body contents to derive a key and then cache the responses using that key. If an identical request is received, the system will provide the cached response, minimizing the risk of ecash loss in the event of network disruptions.

## Requests & Responses

Any Mint implementation should elect a data structure `D` that maps request objects to their respective responses. `D` should be fit for fast insertion, look-up and deletion (eviction) operations.

### Derive & Repeat

Upon the reception of a mint ([NUT-4](04)), swap ([NUT-3](03)) or melt ([NUT-5](05)) `request`, the mint derives a key `k` for it. `k` should depend on the path of `request` as well as the contents of `request`'s payload.

The mint uses `k` to look up a `response = D[k]` and discriminates execution based on the following checks:

- If no cached `response` is found: `request` has no matching `response`. The mint processes `request` as per usual.
- If a cached `response` is found: `request` has a matching `response`. The mint returns the cached `response`.

### Store

After any mint, melt and swap request is processed and the response has been deemed to be successful (`status_code == 200`), Bob should store the response in `D` under key `k` (`D[k] = response`).

### Expiry

Bob autonomously decides the TTL (Time To Live) for each successful response, after which time has passed it can evict the entry from `D`.

## Settings

Support for NUT-19 is announced as an extension to the `nuts` field of the `GetInfoResponse` described in [NUT-6](06).

The entry is structured as follows:

```json
"nuts": {
    ...,
    "19": {
        "ttl": <int|null>,
        "cached_endpoints": [
            {
                "path": "v1/{mint|melt}/{method}",
                "method": "{POST|GET|...}",
            },
            {
                "path": "v1/swap",
                "method": "{POST|GET|...}",
            },
            ...
        ]
    }
}
```

Where:

- `ttl` is the number of seconds the responses are cached for
- `cached_endpoints` is a list of the methods and paths for which caching is enabled.
- `path` and `method` describe the cached route and its method respectively.

If `ttl` is `null`, the responses are expected to be cached _indefinitely_.

## Example

**Requests** of `Alice`:

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/swap
```

With the data being of the form `PostSwapRequest`:

```json
{
  "inputs": <Array[Proof]>,
  "outputs": <Array[BlindedMessage]>,
}
```

With curl:

```bash
for i in {1..5}; do
    curl -X POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/swap -d \
    {
    "inputs":
        [
        {
            "amount": 2,
            "id": "009a1f293253e41e",
            "secret": "407915bc212be61a77e3e6d2aeb4c727980bda51cd06a6afc29e2861768a7837",
            "C": "02bc9097997d81afb2cc7346b5e4345a9346bd2a506eb7958598a72f0cf85163ea"
        },
        {
        ...
        }
        ],
    "outputs":
        [
        {
            "amount": 2,
            "id": "009a1f293253e41e",
            "B_": "02634a2c2b34bec9e8a4aba4361f6bf202d7fa2365379b0840afe249a7a9d71239"
        },
        {
        ...
        }
        ],
    }
done
```

If the first request is successful, `Bob` will respond with 5 identical `PostSwapResponse`s:

```json
{
  "signatures": <Array[BlindSignature]>
}
```
