NUT-12: Offline ecash signature validation
==========================

`optional` `author: calle`

---

In this document, we present an extension of Cashu's crypto system to allow a user Alice to verify the mint Bob's signature using only Bob's public keys. We explain how another user Carol who receives ecash from Alice can execute the DLEQ proof as well. This is achieved using a Discrete Log Equality (DLEQ) proof. Previously, Bob's signature could only be checked by himself using his own private keys ([NUT-00](00)). 

# The DLEQ proof
The purpose of this DLEQ is to prove that the mint has used the same private key `a` for creating its public key `A` ([NUT-01](01)) and for signing the BlindedMessage `B'`. Bob returns the DLEQ proof additional to the blind signature `C'` for a mint or split operation. 

The complete DLEQ proof reads
```
# DLEQ Proof

(These steps occur when Bob returns C')

Bob:
r = random nonce
R1 = r*G
R2 = r*B'
e = hash(R1,R2,A,C')
s = r + e*a
return e, s

Alice:
R1 = s*G - e*A
R2 = s*B' - e*C'
e == hash(R1,R2,A,C')

If true, a in A = a*G must be equal to a in C' = a*B'
```

### Mint to user: DLEQ in `BlindedSignature`

The mint produces these DLEQ proofs when returning `BlindedSignature`'s in the responses for minting ([NUT-04][04]) and splitting ([NUT-06][06]) tokens. The `BlindedSignature` object is extended in the following way to include the DLEQ proof:

```python
{
  "id": <str>,
  "amount": <int>,
  "C_": <str>,
  "dleq": {  # New: DLEQ proof
    "e": <str>,
    "s": <str>
  }
}

```

`e` and `s` are the DLEQ proof. 

### User to user: DLEQ in `Proof`

In order for Alice to communicate the DLEQ to another user Carol, we extend the `Proof` (see [NUT-00](00)) object and include the DLEQ proof. As explained below, we also need to include the blinding factor `r` for the proof to be convincing to another user Carol.

```
{
  "id": <str>,
  "amount": <int>,
  "secret": <str>,
  "C": <str>,
  "dleq": {# New: DLEQ proof
    "e": <str>,
    "s": <str>,
    "r": <str>
  }
}
```
`e` and `s` are the challenge and response of the DLEQ proof returned by Bob, `r` is the blinding factor of Alice that was used to generate the `Proof`. Alice serializes these proofs like any other in a token (see [NUT-00][00]) to send it to another user Carol.

## Alice (minting user) verifies DLEQ proof

When minting or splitting tokens, Alice receives DLEQ proofs in the `BlindedSignature` response from the mint Bob. Alice checks the validity of the DLEQ proofs for each ecash token she receives via the equations:

```
R1 = s*G - e*A
R2 = s*B' - e*C'
e == hash(R1,R2,A,C') # must be True
```

Here, the variables are
- `A` – the public key Bob used to sign this Proof
- `(e, s)` – the DLEQ proof returned by Bob
- `B'` – Alice's `BlindedMessage`
- `C'` – Bob's `BlindedSignature` on `B'`

In order to execute the proof, Alice needs `e, s` that are returned in the `BlindedSignature` by Bob. Alice further needs `B'` (the `BlindedMessage` Alice created and Bob signed) and `C'` (the blind signature in the `BlindedSignature` response) from Bob, and `A` (the public key of Bob with which he signed the BlindedMessage). All these values are available to Alice during or after calling the mint and split operations.

If a DLEQ proof is included in the mint's `BlindedSignature` response, wallets **MUST** verify the DLEQ proof. 

## Carol (another user) verifies DLEQ proof

Carol is a user that receives `Proofs` in a token from another user Alice. When Alice sends `Proofs` with DLEQ proofs to Carol or when Alice posts the `Proofs` publicly, Carol can validate the DLEQ proof herself and verify Bob's signature without having to talk to Bob. Alice includes the following information in the `Proof` (see above):

- `(x, C)` – the ecash `Proof`
- `(e, s)` – the DLEQ proof revealed by Alice
- `r` – Alice's blinding factor

Here, `x` is the Proof's secret, and `C` is the mint's signature on it. To execute the DLEQ proof like Alice did above, Carol needs `(B', C')` which she can compute herself using the blinding factor `r` that she receives from Alice.

To verify the DLEQ proof of a received token, Carol needs to reconstruct `B'` and `C'` using the blinding factor `r` that Alice has included in the `Proof` she sent to Carol. Since Carol now has all the necessary information, she can execute the same equations to verify the DLEQ proof as Alice did:

```
Y = hash_to_curve(x)
C' = C + r*A
B' = Y + r*G

R1 = ... (same as Alice)
```

If a DLEQ proof is included in a received token, wallets **MUST** verify the proof.
