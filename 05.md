# NUT-05: Melting tokens

`mandatory`

`used in: NUT-08, NUT-15`

---

Melting tokens is the opposite of minting tokens (see [NUT-04][04]). Like minting tokens, melting is a two-step process: requesting a melt quote and melting tokens. Here, we describe both steps.

In the first request the wallet asks the mint for a quote for a `request` it wants paid by the mint and the `unit` the wallet would like to spend as inputs. The mint responds with a quote that includes a `quote` id and an `amount` the mint demands in the requested unit. For the method `bolt11`, the mint includes a `fee_reserve` field indicating the reserve fee for a Lightning payment.

In the second request, the wallet includes the `quote` id and provides `inputs` that sum up to `amount+fee+fee_reserve` in the first response where `fee` is calculated from the keyset's `input_fee_ppk` as described in [NUT-02][02]. For the method `bolt11`, the wallet can also include `outputs` in order for the mint to return overpaid Lightning fees (see [NUT-08][08]). The mint responds with a payment `state`. If the `state` is `"PAID"` the response includes a `payment_preimage` as a proof of payment. If the request included `outputs`, the mint may respond with `change` for the overpaid fees (see [NUT-08][08]).

We limit this document to mint quotes of `unit="sat"` and `method="bolt11"` which requests a bolt11 Lightning payment (typically paid by the mint from its Bitcoin reserves) using ecash denominated in Satoshis.

# Melt quote

To request a melt quote, the wallet of `Alice` makes a `POST /v1/melt/quote/{method}` request where `method` is the payment method requested (here `bolt11`).

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/melt/quote/bolt11
```

The wallet `Alice` includes the following `PostMeltQuoteBolt11Request` data in its request:

```json
{
  "request": <str>,
  "unit": <str_enum[UNIT]>
  "options": { // Optional
    "amountless": {
      "amount_msat": <int>
    }
  }
}
```

Here, `request` is the bolt11 Lightning invoice to be paid and `unit` is the unit the wallet would like to pay with. `amount` **MAY** be passed to pay amountless bolt11 invoices. The `amount` **MUST** be in msat and if the bolt11 invoice has an amount, the `amount` field **MUST** be equal to the amount of the bolt11 invoice. The request **MAY** be an amountless invoice only if support for amountless invoices is signaled in the `MeltMethodSettings`.

The mint `Bob` then responds with a `PostMeltQuoteBolt11Response`:

```json
{
  "quote": <str>,
  "request": <str>,
  "amount": <int>,
  "unit": <str_enum[UNIT]>,
  "fee_reserve": <int>,
  "state": <str_enum[STATE]>,
  "expiry": <int>,
  "payment_preimage": <str|null>
}
```

Where `quote` is the quote ID, `amount` and `unit` the amount and unit that need to be provided, `request` the payment request from the quote request, and `fee_reserve` the additional fee reserve that is required. The mint expects `Alice` to include `Proofs` of _at least_ `total_amount = amount + fee_reserve`. `expiry` is the Unix timestamp until which the melt quote is valid. `payment_preimage` is the bolt11 payment preimage in case of a successful payment.

`state` is an enum string field with possible values `"UNPAID"`, `"PENDING"`, `"PAID"`:

- `"UNPAID"` means that the request has not been paid yet.
- `"PENDING"` means that the request is currently being paid.
- `"PAID"` means that the request has been paid successfully.

## Example

Request of `Alice` with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/melt/quote/bolt11 -d \
{
  "request": "lnbc100n1p3kdrv5sp5lpdxzghe5j67q...",
  "unit": "sat"
}
```

Response of `Bob`:

```json
{
  "quote": "TRmjduhIsPxd...",
  "request": "lnbc100n1p3kdrv5sp5lpdxzghe5j67q...",
  "amount": 10,
  "unit": "sat",
  "fee_reserve": 2,
  "state": "UNPAID",
  "expiry": 1701704757
}
```

## Check melt quote state

To check whether a melt quote has been paid, `Alice` makes a `GET /v1/melt/quote/bolt11/{quote_id}`.

```http
GET https://mint.host:3338/v1/melt/quote/bolt11/{quote_id}
```

Like before, the mint `Bob` responds with a `PostMeltQuoteBolt11Response`.

Example request of `Alice` with curl:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3338/v1/melt/quote/bolt11/TRmjduhIsPxd...
```

# Melting tokens

Now that `Alice` knows what the total amount is (`amount + fee + fee_reserve`) in her requested `unit`, she can proceed for melting tokens for which a payment will be executed by the mint. She calls the `POST /v1/melt/{method}` endpoint where `method` is the payment method requested (here `bolt11`).

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/melt/bolt11
```

⚠️ **Attention:** This call will block until the Lightning payment either succeeds or fails. This can take quite a long time in case the Lightning payment is slow. Make sure to **use no (or a very long) timeout when making this call**!

The wallet of `Alice` includes the following `PostMeltBolt11Request` data in its request

```json
{
  "quote": <str>,
  "inputs": <Array[Proof]>
}
```

Here, `quote` is the melt quote ID to be paid and `inputs` are the proofs with a total amount of at least `amount + fee + fee_reserve` (see previous melt quote response).

Like before, the mint `Bob` then responds with a `PostMeltQuoteBolt11Response`. If the payment was successful, the `state` field is set to `"PAID"` and the response includes the `payment_preimage` field containing the payment secret of the bolt11 payment.

If `state=="PAID"`, `Alice`'s wallet can delete the `inputs` from her database (or move them to a history). If `state=="UNPAID"`, `Alice` can repeat the same request again until the payment is successful.

## Example

Request of `Alice` with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/melt/bolt11 -d \
'{
  "quote": "od4CN5smMMS3K3QVHkbGGNCTxfcAIyIXeq8IrfhP",
  "inputs": [
    {
      "amount": 4,
      "id": "009a1f293253e41e",
      "secret": "429700b812a58436be2629af8731a31a37fce54dbf8cbbe90b3f8553179d23f5",
      "C": "03b01869f528337e161a6768b480fcf9f75fd248b649c382f5e352489fd84fd011",
    },
    {
      "amount": 8,
      "id": "009a1f293253e41e",
      "secret": "4f3155acef6481108fcf354f6d06e504ce8b441e617d30c88924991298cdbcad",
      "C": "0278ab1c1af35487a5ea903b693e96447b2034d0fd6bac529e753097743bf73ca9",
    }
  ]
}'
```

Response `PostMeltQuoteBolt11Response` of `Bob`:

```json
{
  "quote": "TRmjduhIsPxd...",
  "request": "lnbc100n1p3kdrv5sp5lpdxzghe5j67q...",
  "amount": 10,
  "unit": "sat",
  "fee_reserve": 2,
  "state": "PAID",
  "expiry": 1701704757,
  "payment_preimage": "c5a1ae1f639e1f4a3872e81500fd028bece7bedc1152f740cba5c3417b748c1b"
}
```

## Settings

The mint's settings for this nut indicate the supported method-unit pairs for melting. They are part of the info response of the mint ([NUT-06][06]) which in this case reads

```json
{
  "5": {
    "methods": [
      <MeltMethodSetting>,
      ...
    ],
    "disabled": <bool>
  }
}
```

`MeltMethodSetting` indicates supported `method` and `unit` pairs and additional settings of the mint. `disabled` indicates whether melting is disabled.

`MeltMethodSetting` is of the form:

```json
{
  "method": <str>,
  "unit": <str>,
  "min_amount": <int|null>,
  "max_amount": <int|null>,
  "amountless": <bool|null>
}
```

`min_amount` and `max_amount` indicate the minimum and maximum amount for an operation of this method-unit pair. `amountless` signals if the backed supports paying an amountless invoice.

Example `MeltMethodSetting`:

```json
{
  "method": "bolt11",
  "unit": "sat",
  "min_amount": 100,
  "max_amount": 10000,
  "amountless": true
}
```
