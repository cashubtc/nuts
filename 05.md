# NUT-05: Melting tokens

`mandatory`

`used in: NUT-08, NUT-15, NUT-23`

---

Melting tokens is the opposite of minting tokens (see [NUT-04][04]). Like minting tokens, melting is a two-step process: requesting a melt quote and melting tokens. This document describes the general flow that applies to all payment methods, with specifics for each supported payment method provided in dedicated method-specific NUTs.

## Supported methods

Method-specific NUTs describe how to handle different payment methods. The currently specified models are:

- [NUT-23][23] for bolt11 Lightning invoices
- [NUT-25][25] for bolt12 Lightning offers

## General Flow

The melting process follows these steps for all payment methods:

1. The wallet requests a melt quote for a `request` it wants paid by the mint, specifying the payment `method` and the `unit` the wallet would like to spend
2. The mint responds with a quote that includes a `quote` id and an `amount` demanded in the requested unit
3. The wallet sends a melting request including the `quote` id and provides `inputs` of the required amount
4. The mint executes the payment and responds with the payment `state` and any method-specific proof of payment

## Common Request and Response Formats

### Requesting a Melt Quote

To request a melt quote, the wallet of `Alice` makes a `POST /v1/melt/quote/{method}` request where `method` is the payment method requested (e.g., `bolt11`, `bolt12`, etc.).

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/melt/quote/{method}
```

Depending on the payment method, the request structure may vary, but all methods will include at minimum:

```json
{
  "request": <str>,
  "unit": <str_enum[UNIT]>
  // Additional method-specific fields will be required
}
```

The mint `Bob` responds with a quote that includes some common fields for all methods:

```json
{
  "quote": <str>,
  "amount": <int>,
  "unit": <str_enum[UNIT]>,
  "state": <str_enum[STATE]>,
  "expiry": <int>
  // Additional method-specific fields will be included
}
```

Where `quote` is the quote ID, `amount` and `unit` the amount and unit that need to be provided, and `expiry` is the Unix timestamp until which the melt quote is valid.

`state` is an enum string field with possible values `"UNPAID"`, `"PENDING"`, `"PAID"`:

- `"UNPAID"` means that the request has not been paid yet.
- `"PENDING"` means that the request is currently being paid.
- `"PAID"` means that the request has been paid successfully.

### Check Melt Quote State

To check whether a melt quote has been paid, the wallet makes a `GET /v1/melt/quote/{method}/{quote_id}`.

```http
GET https://mint.host:3338/v1/melt/quote/{method}/{quote_id}
```

The mint responds with the same structure as the initial quote response.

### Executing a Melt Quote

To execute the melting process, the wallet calls the `POST /v1/melt/{method}` endpoint.

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/v1/melt/{method}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For methods that involve external payments (like Lightning), this call may block until the payment either succeeds or fails. This can take a long time. Make sure to **use no (or a very long) timeout when making this call**!

The wallet includes the following common data in its request:

```json
{
  "quote": <str>,
  "inputs": <Array[Proof]>
  // Additional method-specific fields may be required
}
```

where `quote` is the melt quote ID and `inputs` are the proofs with a total amount sufficient to cover the requested amount plus any fees.

The mint responds with a structure that indicates the payment state and includes any method-specific proof of payment when successful.

## Adding New Payment Methods

To add a new payment method (e.g., BOLT12), implement the following:

1. Define the method-specific request and response structures following the pattern above
2. Implement the three required endpoints: quote request, quote check, and melt execution
3. Update the settings to include the new method
4. Document any method-specific fields or behaviors that differ from the general flow

## Settings

The mint's settings for this NUT indicate the supported method-unit pairs for melting. They are part of the info response of the mint ([NUT-06][06]):

```json
{
  "5": {
    "methods": [
      <MeltMethodSetting>,
      ...
    ],
    "disabled": <bool>
  }
}
```

`MeltMethodSetting` indicates supported `method` and `unit` pairs and additional settings of the mint. `disabled` indicates whether melting is disabled.

`MeltMethodSetting` is of the form:

```json
{
  "method": <str>,
  "unit": <str>,
  "min_amount": <int|null>,
  "max_amount": <int|null>,
  "options": <Object|null>
}
```

`min_amount` and `max_amount` indicate the minimum and maximum amount for an operation of this method-unit pair. `options` are method-specific and can be defined in method-specific NUTs.
