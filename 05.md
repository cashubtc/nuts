NUT-05: Melting tokens
==========================

`mandatory` `author: calle`

---

Melting tokens is the opposite of minting tokens (see [NUT-04][04]). The wallet of `Alice` sends `Proofs` to the mint `Bob` together with a bolt11 Lightning invoice that `Alice` wants to be paid. To melt tokens, `Alice` sends a `POST /melt` request with a JSON body to the mint. The `Proofs` included in the request will be burned by the mint and the mint will pay the invoice in exchange. 

`Alice` needs to send two requests to `Bob` to make a Lightning payment: one request for checking the expected maximum fees, and one for making the actual payment. In the first request, `Alice` must check the expected maximum fee reserve with the mint by including a `CheckFeesRequest` JSON body with her request. In the second request, `Alice` must include a `PostMeltRequest` JSON body with `Proofs` that have *at least* the amount of the invoice to be paid.

## Checking Lightning fees

The mint expects `Alice` to include `Proofs` of *at least* `total_amount = amount + fee_reserve` where `amount` is the amount to be paid with the Lightning invoice and `fee_reserve` is the maximum potential Lightning network fees for the payment. A wallet should first call the `/checkfees` endpoint to ask the mint what the expected maximum fee is by making a `CheckFeesRequest` post request to the following endpoint:

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/checkfees
```
With the data being of the form `CheckFeesRequest`:

```json
{
  "pr": str
}
```

Here, `pr` is the bolt11 Lightning invoice to be paid.

With curl:

```bash
curl -X POST https://mint.host:3338/checkfees -d \
{
"pr": "lnbc100n1p3kdrv5sp5lpdxzghe5j67q..."
}
```

**Response** `CheckFeesResponse` from `Bob`:

```json
{
"fee": int
}
```
Here, `fee` is the expected maximum fees in satoshis.

## Paying the invoice

Now that `Alice` knows what the `total_amount` has to be, she can ask `Bob` to make a Lightning payment for her.

**Request** of `Alice`:

```http
POST https://mint.host:3338/melt
```

⚠️ **Attention:** This call will block until the Lighting payment either succeeds or fails. This can take quite a long time in case the Lightning payment is slow. Make sure to **use an infinite timeout when making this call**!

With the data being of the form `PostMeltRequest`:

```json
{
  "proofs": 
    [
      Proof,
      ...
    ],
  "pr": str
}
```

Here, `pr` is the bolt11 invoice to be paid with an amount `amount` and `proofs` are the proofs with a total value of at least `total_amount := amount + fee_reserve` (see above).

With curl:

```bash
curl -X POST https://mint.host:3338/melt -d \
{
"proofs" : 
  [
    {
    "id": "DSAl9nvvyfva",
    "amount": 2,
    "secret": "S+tDfc1Lfsrb06zaRdVTed6Izg",
    "C": "0242b0fb43804d8ba9a64ceef249ad7a60f42c15fe6d4907238b05e857527832a3"
    },
    {
    ...
    }
  ],
"pr": "lnbc100n1p3kdrv5sp5lpdxzghe5j67q..."
}
```

**Response** `PostMeltResponse` from `Bob`:

```json
{
"paid": true,
"preimage": "da225c115418671b64a67d1d9ea6a..."
}
```

Only if the `paid==true`, the wallet `Alice` must delete the `Proofs` from her database (or move them to a history). If `paid==false`, `Alice` can repeat the same request again until the payment is successful.
